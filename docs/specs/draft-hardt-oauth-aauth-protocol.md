.# Abstract

This document defines the AAuth authorization protocol for agent-to-resource authorization and identity claim retrieval. The protocol supports four resource access modes — identity-based, resource-managed (two-party), PS-asserted (three-party), and federated (four-party) — with agent governance as an orthogonal layer. It builds on the HTTP Signature Keys specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]) for HTTP Message Signatures and key discovery.

# Introduction

## HTTP Clients Need Their Own Identity

In OAuth 2.0 [@!RFC6749] and OpenID Connect [@OpenID.Core], the client has no independent identity. Client identifiers are issued by each authorization server or OpenID provider — a `client_id` at Google is meaningless at GitHub. The client's identity exists only in the context of each server it has pre-registered with. This made sense when the web had a manageable number of integrations and a human developer could visit each portal to register.

API keys are the same model pushed further: a shared secret issued by a service, copied to the client, and used as a bearer credential. The problem is that any secret that must be copied to where the workload runs will eventually be copied somewhere it shouldn't be.

SPIFFE and WIMSE brought workload identity to enterprise infrastructure — a workload can prove who it is without shared secrets. But these operate within a single enterprise's trust domain. They don't help an agent that needs to access resources across organizational boundaries, or a developer's tool that runs outside any enterprise platform.

AAuth starts from this premise: every agent has its own cryptographic identity. An agent identifier (`aauth:local@domain`) is bound to a signing key, published at a well-known URL, and verifiable by any party — no pre-registration, no shared secrets, no dependency on a particular server. At its simplest, an agent signs a request and a resource decides what to do based on who the agent is. This identity-based access replaces API keys and is the foundation that authorization, governance, and federation build on incrementally.

## Agents Are Different

Traditional software knows at build time what services it will call and what permissions it needs. Registration, key provisioning, and scope configuration happen before the first request. This works when the set of integrations is fixed and known in advance.

Agents don't work this way. They discover resources at runtime. They execute long-running tasks that span multiple services across trust domains. They need to explain what they're doing and why. They need authorization decisions mid-task, long after the user set them in motion. A protocol designed for pre-registered clients with fixed integrations cannot serve agents that discover their needs as they go.

## What AAuth Provides

- **Agent identity without pre-registration**: A domain, static metadata, and a JWKS establish identity with no portal, no bilateral agreement, no shared secret.
- **Per-instance identity**: Each agent instance gets its own identifier (`aauth:local@domain`) and signing key.
- **Proof-of-possession on every request**: HTTP Message Signatures ([@!RFC9421]) bind every request the agent makes to the agent's key — a stolen token is useless without the private key.
- **Two-party mode with first-call registration**: An agent calls a resource it has never contacted before; the resource returns `AAuth-Requirement`; a browser interaction handles account creation, payment, and consent. The first API call is the registration.
- **Tool-call governance**: A person server (PS) represents the user and manages what tools the agent can call, providing permission and audit for tool use — no resource involved.
- **Missions**: Optional scoped authorization contexts that span multiple resources. The agent proposes what it intends to do in natural language; the person server provides full context — mission, history, justification — to the appropriate decision-maker (human or AI); every resource access is evaluated in context. Missions enable governance over decisions that cannot be reduced to predefined machine-evaluable rules.
- **Cross-domain federation**: The PS federates with access servers (AS) — the policy engines that guard resources — to enable access across trust domains without the agent needing to know about each one.
- **Clarification chat**: Users can ask questions during consent; agents can explain or adjust their requests.
- **Progressive adoption**: Each party can adopt independently; modes build on each other.
- **Asynchronous event delivery**: Agents receive events from resources through the AP, without requiring a public endpoint. Resources post event tokens to the AP's event endpoint; the AP routes them to the agent. Defined in AAuth Events ([@?I-D.hardt-aauth-events]).

## What AAuth Does Not Do

- Does not require centralized identity providers — agents publish their own identity
- Does not use shared secrets or bearer tokens — every credential is bound to a signing key and useless without it
- Does not require coordination to adopt — each party adds support independently

## Relationship to Existing Standards

AAuth builds on existing standards and design patterns:

- **OpenID Connect vocabulary**: AAuth reuses OpenID Connect scope values, identity claims, and enterprise extensions ([@OpenID.Enterprise]), lowering the adoption barrier for identity-aware resources.
- **Well-known metadata and key discovery**: Servers publish metadata at well-known URLs ([@!RFC8615]) and signing keys via JWKS endpoints, following the pattern established by OAuth Authorization Server Metadata ([@RFC8414]) and OpenID Connect Discovery ([@OpenID.Core]).
- **HTTP Message Signatures**: All requests are signed with HTTP Message Signatures ([@!RFC9421]) using keys bound to tokens conveyed via the Signature-Key header ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]), providing proof-of-possession, identity, and message integrity on every call.

The HTTP Signature Keys specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]) defines how signing keys are bound to JWTs and discovered via well-known metadata, and how agents present cryptographic identity using HTTP Message Signatures ([@!RFC9421]). This specification defines the `AAuth-Requirement`, `AAuth-Access`, and `AAuth-Capabilities` headers, and the authorization protocol across four resource access modes.

Because agent identity is independent and self-contained, AAuth is designed for incremental adoption: each party can add support independently, and rollout does not need to be coordinated. A resource that verifies an agent's signature can manage access by identity alone, with no other infrastructure; adding a person server and an access server is additive. The four resource access modes and the orthogonal agent-governance layer are introduced in (#protocol-overview) and detailed in (#incremental-adoption).

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

In HTTP examples throughout this document, line breaks and indentation are added for readability. Actual HTTP messages do not contain these extra line breaks.

# Terminology

Parties:

- **Person**: A user or organization — the legal person — on whose behalf an agent acts and who is accountable for the agent's actions.
- **Agent**: An HTTP client ([@!RFC9110], Section 3.5) acting on behalf of a person. Identified by an agent identifier URI using the `aauth` scheme, of the form `aauth:local@domain` (#agent-identifiers). An agent MAY have a person server, declared via the `ps` claim in the agent token.
- **Agent Provider (AP)**: A server that manages agent identity and issues agent tokens to agents. Trusted by the person to issue agent tokens only to authorized agents. Identified by an HTTPS URL (#server-identifiers) and publishes metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-agent.json`.
- **Resource**: A server that requires authentication and/or authorization to protect access to its APIs and data. A resource MAY enforce access policy itself or delegate policy evaluation to an access server. Identified by an HTTPS URL (#server-identifiers) and publishes metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-resource.json`. A mission-aware resource includes the mission reference from the `AAuth-Mission` header in the resource tokens it issues.
- **Person Server (PS)**: A server that represents the person to the rest of the protocol. The person chooses their PS; it is not imposed by any other party. The PS manages missions, handles consent, asserts user identity, and brokers authorization on behalf of agents. Identified by an HTTPS URL (#server-identifiers) and publishes metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-person.json`.
- **Access Server (AS)**: A policy engine that evaluates token requests, applies resource policy, and issues auth tokens on behalf of a resource. Identified by an HTTPS URL (#server-identifiers) and publishes metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-access.json`.

Tokens:

- **Agent Token**: Issued by an agent provider to establish the agent's identity. MAY declare the agent's person server (#agent-tokens).
- **Resource Token**: Issued by a resource to describe the access the agent needs (#resource-tokens).
- **Auth Token**: Issued by a PS or AS to grant an agent access to a resource, containing identity claims and/or authorized scopes (#auth-tokens).

Protocol concepts:

- **Mission**: A scoped authorization context for agent governance (#missions). Required when the person's PS requires governance over the agent's actions. A mission is a JSON object containing structured fields (approver, agent, approved_at, approved tools) and a Markdown description. Identified by the PS and SHA-256 hash of the mission JSON (`s256`). Missions are proposed by agents and approved by the PS and person.
- **Mission Reference**: The pair of the `approver` URL and the `s256` hash that identifies a mission in the `AAuth-Mission` header and in the `mission` claim of resource tokens and auth tokens, without carrying the mission's content. Distinct from the full mission JSON (the **mission blob**), which only the agent and PS hold (#mission-approval).
- **Mission Log**: The ordered record of all agent↔PS interactions within a mission — token requests, permission requests, audit records, interaction requests, and clarification chats. The PS maintains the log and uses it to evaluate whether each new request is consistent with the mission's intent (#mission-log).
- **HTTP Sig**: An HTTP Message Signature ([@!RFC9421]) created per the AAuth HTTP Message Signatures profile defined in this specification (#http-message-signatures-profile), using a key conveyed via the `Signature-Key` header ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]).
- **Markdown**: AAuth uses Markdown ([@CommonMark]) as the human-readable content format for mission descriptions, justifications, clarifications, and scope descriptions. Implementations MUST sanitize Markdown before rendering to users.
- **Interaction**: User authentication, consent, or other action at an interaction endpoint (#user-interaction). Triggered when a server returns `202 Accepted` with `requirement=interaction`.
- **Justification**: A Markdown string provided by the agent declaring why access is needed, presented to the user by the PS during consent (#ps-token-endpoint).
- **Clarification**: A Markdown string containing a question posed to the agent by the user during consent via the PS (#clarification-chat). The agent may respond with an explanation or an updated request.

# Protocol Overview

All AAuth tokens are JWTs verified using a JWK retrieved from the `jwks_uri` in the issuer's well-known metadata, binding each token to the server that issued it.

AAuth has two dimensions: **resource access modes** and **agent governance**. Resource access modes define how an agent gets authorized at a resource. Agent governance — missions, plus per-action permission, audit, and interaction relay through a person server — is an orthogonal layer that any agent with a person server can add, independent of which access mode the resource supports.

## Resource Access Modes

AAuth supports four resource access modes, each adding parties and capabilities. The protocol works in every mode — adoption does not require coordination between parties. Identity-based and resource-managed access both involve only the agent and the resource; the "(two-party)" label is shorthand for resource-managed access, where the resource runs an authorization flow rather than deciding on identity alone.

| Mode | Parties | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Identity-based access | Agent <br/> Resource | Resource verifies agent's signed identity and applies its own access control |
| Resource-managed access <br/>(two-party) | Agent <br/> Resource | Resource manages authorization with interaction, consent, or existing auth infrastructure |
| PS-asserted access <br/>(three-party) | Agent <br/> Resource <br/> PS | Resource issues resource token to PS; <br/> PS asserts identity and consent for the requested scope; <br/> resource applies its own policy |
| Federated access <br/>(four-party) | Agent <br/> Resource <br/> PS <br/> AS | Resource has its own access server; <br/> PS federates with AS |

The following diagram shows all parties and their relationships. Not all parties or relationships are present in every mode.

Figure: Protocol Parties and Relationships {#fig-parties}

- **Agent Provider → Agent**: Issues an agent token binding the agent's signing key to its identity.
- **Agent ↔ Resource**: Agent sends signed requests; resource returns responses. In PS-asserted and federated modes, the resource also returns resource tokens at its authorization endpoint.
- **Agent ↔ PS**: Agent sends resource tokens to obtain auth tokens. With governance, agent also creates missions and requests permissions.
- **PS ↔ AS**: Federation (four-party only). The PS sends the resource token to the AS; the AS returns an auth token.
- **Person ↔ PS**: Mission approval and consent for resource access.

Detailed end-to-end flows are in (#detailed-flows). The following subsections describe each mode.

### Identity-Based Access {#overview-identity-access}

The agent signs requests with its agent token (#agent-tokens). The resource verifies the agent's identity via HTTP signatures and applies its own access control policy — granting or denying based on who the agent is. This replaces API keys with cryptographic identity. No authorization flow, no tokens beyond the agent token.

### Resource-Managed Access (Two-Party) {#overview-resource-managed}

The resource handles authorization itself — via interaction (#user-interaction), existing OAuth/OIDC infrastructure, or internal policy. After authorization, the resource MAY return an `AAuth-Access` header (#aauth-access) with an opaque access token for subsequent calls.

~~~
Figure: Resource-Managed Access (Two-Party) {#fig-resource-managed}

### PS-Asserted Access (Three-Party)

The resource has no separate access server — it accepts identity claims from whichever PS the agent declares, and applies its own policy on the resulting claims. The resource discovers the agent's PS from the `ps` claim in the agent token and issues a resource token (#resource-tokens) with `aud` = PS URL. The agent obtains the resource token either by calling the resource's `authorization_endpoint` (if published in resource metadata) or by receiving a `401` challenge with `requirement=auth-token` when calling the resource directly (#requirement-auth-token). The agent sends the resource token to the PS's token endpoint (#ps-token-endpoint), and the PS returns an auth token (#auth-tokens) asserting identity claims about the user (`sub`, optionally `email`, `tenant`, `groups`, `roles`) and confirming user consent for the scope the resource requested. The resource applies its own access policy on the resulting claims. Any agent's PS can assert identity claims to any resource without bilateral setup; the resource namespaces those claims by the asserting PS — the same `sub` value from a different PS is a different subject. As in many OIDC deployments, registration and login share a single flow (see (#trust-posture-in-ps-asserted-access) for how the resource matches or creates a user record from `(iss, sub)`).

### Federated Access (Four-Party)

The resource has its own access server. The resource issues a resource token (#resource-tokens) with `aud` = AS URL — either via its `authorization_endpoint` or a `401` challenge (#requirement-auth-token). The PS federates with the AS (#ps-as-federation) to obtain the auth token (#auth-tokens).

Figure: Federated Access (Four-Party) {#fig-federated}

## Roles {#roles}

Agent, AP, Resource, PS, and AS are **roles**, not deployment units. Each role has its own protocol identity — the Agent by an `aauth:local@domain` URI attested by an agent token, and AP, Resource, PS, and AS each by a distinct HTTPS URL with metadata published at a distinct well-known path. A single deployment unit MAY fill multiple roles, by hosting metadata for multiple server roles under a shared origin and/or by holding an agent token in addition to acting as a server. The protocol treats each role independently regardless of collocation — every interaction is a normal protocol exchange between role identifiers, even when the underlying servers are the same.

Common collocations:

- **PS + AS**: One server brokers user consent and evaluates resource policy. Federation collapses to a single internal evaluation. See (#ps-as-collapse).
- **Resource + Agent**: A resource acts as an agent for downstream calls, publishing agent metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-agent.json` so downstream parties can verify its identity. See (#call-chaining).
- **AP + Resource**: An agent provider exposes its own services to the agents it issues tokens to — publishing metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-resource.json` and issuing resource tokens. This enables the agent to obtain auth tokens from its PS for the agent provider's own services or infrastructure, using the standard resource token flow. How the agent obtains the resource token from the agent provider is out of scope of this specification. No mission is required.
- **Agent + AP**: A self-hosted agent is its own agent provider, self-issuing agent tokens signed by a JWKS-published key the user controls. See [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap].
- **Org-wide bundle**: A single organizational server may operate AP + PS + AS for employees and internal resources, with federation incurred only at the boundary when an internal agent accesses an external resource.

An AP that supports AAuth Events ([@?I-D.hardt-aauth-events]) additionally acts as an event router — it receives event tokens from resources on behalf of agents and routes them to the appropriate agent instance. This is an extension of the AP role, not a new party.

These are deployment choices that do not change the wire protocol. A receiver verifies each role's tokens and metadata identically whether the role is on its own server or collocated with others.

## Policy Evaluation Points {#policy-evaluation-points}

Policy decisions in AAuth evaluate what the agent is doing. The Agent is the subject of every decision; the four server roles (AP, PS, AS, Resource) each evaluate the agent's activity from their own vantage point, in their own scope. No single party is the policy decision point — and token lifetimes give every server role a natural re-evaluation cadence.

- **Agent Provider** decides whether to continue treating the agent as authorized — based on device posture, attestation freshness, network location, account status, or any other AP-internal criteria — and enforces that decision by issuing or refusing fresh agent tokens.
- **Person Server** decides whether to issue an auth token for a given resource and scope — based on user consent and, when the agent is operating under a mission, the mission's intent and prior log entries against the PS's governance policy.
- **Access Server** decides whether to issue an auth token on behalf of the resource — based on resource policy, the claims the PS has provided, and any further requirements (interaction, payment, claims) gathered via deferred responses.
- **Resource** plays two roles in policy: it *decides what is required* to access the resource at the moment it issues a resource token (audience, scope, mission requirement), and it *enforces* the resulting auth token at the moment of access (signature verification, proof-of-possession, access rules).

All AAuth tokens have limited lifetimes, so each issuance is a natural re-evaluation point. An auth token that lives for an hour means every party that contributed to its issuance gets a fresh decision opportunity every hour — combined with real-time revocation (#token-revocation), this produces layered control without any single party needing to coordinate with the others.

## Agent Governance {#agent-governance}

Agent governance is orthogonal to resource access modes. Any agent with a person server (`ps` claim in agent token) can use the PS for governance, regardless of which access modes the resources it accesses support.

### Missions {#missions-overview}

When the person's PS requires governance over the agent's actions, the agent creates a mission — a Markdown description of what it intends to accomplish. The PS and user review, clarify, and approve the mission. The approved mission is immutable — bound by its `s256` hash. Missions evolve through the **mission log** (#mission-log): the ordered record of all agent↔PS interactions within the mission. Missions are not required for all PS interactions — an agent can get auth tokens without a mission. See (#missions) for normative requirements.

#### Mission Creation {#mission-creation-overview}

The agent proposes a mission at the PS. The PS and user may clarify and refine before approving.

Figure: Mission Creation and Approval {#fig-mission}

#### Mission Context at Resources

The agent includes the `AAuth-Mission` header when sending requests to resources, unless the mission is already conveyed in an auth token. The resource includes the mission reference in the resource token it issues:

#### Mission Completion {#mission-completion-overview}

When the agent believes the mission is complete, it proposes completion via the interaction endpoint with a summary. The PS presents the summary to the user. The user either accepts (mission terminates) or responds with follow-up questions (mission continues).

### PS Governance Endpoints

The PS provides three governance endpoints. The **permission** (#permission-endpoint) and **interaction** (#interaction-endpoint) endpoints work with or without a mission. The **audit** endpoint (#audit-endpoint) requires a mission.

- **Permission endpoint**: Request permission for actions not governed by a remote resource — tool calls, file writes, sending messages.
- **Audit endpoint**: Log actions performed, providing the PS with a complete record for the mission log.
- **Interaction endpoint**: Reach the user through the PS — relay interactions, ask questions, forward payment approvals, or propose mission completion.

## Obtaining an Agent Token

The agent obtains an agent token from its agent provider. The agent generates a signing key pair, proves its identity to the agent provider through a platform-specific mechanism, and receives an agent token binding the signing key to the agent's identifier. The agent token MAY include a `ps` claim identifying the agent's person server. Agent token structure and normative requirements are defined in (#agent-tokens). Acquisition is platform-dependent; see [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap] for common patterns.

## Bootstrapping

Before protocol flows begin, each entity must be established with its identity, keys, and relationships. The requirements build incrementally.

Acquiring the agent token — the AP-side enrollment ceremony, including per-platform key handling, optional platform attestation, and token refresh — is informational and described in [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap]. This section lists the cross-mode setup each party completes before protocol flows begin.

**All modes:**

- Agent obtains an agent token from its agent provider, binding its signing key to its identifier (`aauth:local@domain`). See [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap].
- Agent providers publish metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-agent.json` (#agent-provider-metadata).

**Identity-based access and above:**

- Resources MAY publish metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-resource.json` (#resource-metadata) to be discoverable. The metadata SHOULD declare `access_mode` (the credential flow agents should expect) and SHOULD advertise an R3 vocabulary (`r3_vocabularies`, [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-r3]) describing the resource's operations, so that an agent that knows only the resource's hostname can learn the API and begin using it (#consuming-a-resource). Resources that do not publish metadata can still verify identity-based access, and issue resource tokens and interaction requirements via `401` responses.

**PS-asserted access (three-party) and above:**

- The agent's agent token MUST include the `ps` claim identifying its person server. This is configured during agent setup (e.g., set by the agent provider or chosen by the person deploying the agent).
- The PS maintains the association between an agent and its person. This association is typically established when the person first authorizes the agent at the PS via the interaction flow. An organization administrator may also pre-authorize agents for the organization.
- The PS MAY establish a direct communication channel with the user (e.g., email, push notification, or messaging) to support out-of-band authorization, approval notifications, and revocation alerts.
- Person servers publish metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-person.json` (#ps-metadata).
- The resource discovers the agent's PS from the `ps` claim in the agent token and issues resource tokens with `aud` = PS URL.

**Federated access (four-party):**

- Access servers publish metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-access.json` (#access-server-metadata).
- The resource issues resource tokens with `aud` = AS URL.
- The PS and the resource's AS must have a trust relationship before the AS will issue auth tokens. This trust may be pre-established (through a business relationship) or established dynamically through the AS's token endpoint responses — interaction, payment, or claims. When an organization controls both the PS and AS, trust is implicit. See (#ps-as-federation) for details.

# Agent Identity {#agent-identity}

This section defines agent identity — how agents are identified and how that identity is bound to signing keys via agent tokens. Agent identity is the foundation of AAuth: the agent token binds the agent's identifier to its signing key, and every other token the agent obtains (resource tokens, auth tokens) is issued in response to a request signed by that key. When an agent presents an auth token to a resource, the auth token's `cnf` claim binds it to the same key — so the agent's identity, established by the agent token, ultimately authorizes every signed request whether the `Signature-Key` header carries the agent token or an auth token.

## Agent Identifiers

Agent identifiers are URIs using the `aauth` scheme, of the form `aauth:local@domain` where `domain` is the agent provider's domain. The `local` part MUST consist of lowercase ASCII letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), hyphen (`-`), underscore (`_`), plus (`+`), and period (`.`). The `local` part MUST NOT be empty and MUST NOT exceed 255 characters. The `domain` part MUST be a valid domain name conforming to the server identifier requirements (#server-identifiers) (without scheme).

The plus character (`+`) is RESERVED as the sub-agent delimiter (#sub-agents). A top-level agent's `local` part MUST NOT contain `+`. A sub-agent's `local` part MUST be its parent's `local` part, followed by `+`, followed by a non-empty discriminator (for example, `planner.7f3c+search1`). This naming is for operational readability only — a sub-agent's identifier shows its parent at a glance in logs. Parties MUST NOT parse the `local` part for protocol decisions; the `parent_agent` claim (#sub-agents) is the authoritative sub-agent marker and names the parent.

Valid agent identifiers:

- `aauth:assistant-v2@agent.example`
- `aauth:planner.7f3c@vendor.example` (top-level)
- `aauth:planner.7f3c+search1@vendor.example` (sub-agent of `planner.7f3c`)

Invalid agent identifiers:

- `My Agent@agent.example` (uppercase letters and space in local part)
- `@agent.example` (empty local part)
- `agent@http://agent.example` (domain includes scheme)

Implementations MUST perform exact string comparison on agent identifiers (case-sensitive).

## Agent Token {#agent-tokens}

### Agent Token Acquisition {#agent-token-acquisition-overview}

An agent MUST obtain an agent token from its agent provider before participating in the AAuth protocol. The acquisition process follows these steps:

1. The agent generates a signing key pair (EdDSA is RECOMMENDED).
2. The agent proves its identity to the agent provider through a platform-specific mechanism.
3. The agent provider verifies the agent's identity and issues an agent token binding the agent's public key to the agent's identifier.

The mechanism for proving identity is platform-dependent. See [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap] for common patterns including self-hosted agents, browser-based applications, and mobile applications.

### Agent Token Structure

An agent token is a JWT with `typ: aa-agent+jwt` containing:

Header:
- `alg`: Signing algorithm. EdDSA is RECOMMENDED. Implementations MUST NOT accept `none`.
- `typ`: `aa-agent+jwt`
- `kid`: Key identifier

Required payload claims:
- `iss`: Agent provider URL
- `dwk`: `aauth-agent.json` — the well-known metadata document name for key discovery ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key])
- `sub`: Agent identifier (stable across key rotations)
- `jti`: Unique token identifier for replay detection, audit, and revocation
- `cnf`: Confirmation claim ([@!RFC7800]) with `jwk` containing the agent's public key
- `iat`: Issued at timestamp
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp. Agent tokens SHOULD NOT have a lifetime exceeding 24 hours.

Optional payload claims:
- `ps`: The HTTPS URL of the agent's person server. Configured per agent instance. When present, resources can discover the agent's PS from the agent token. This claim is distinct from `iss` (which identifies the agent provider that issued the token).
- `parent_agent`: Sub-agent marker (#sub-agents). When present, the agent is a sub-agent and the value is the identifier of its parent agent. A sub-agent MUST NOT request authorization directly; its parent obtains auth tokens on its behalf (#sub-agents).

Agent providers MAY include additional claims in the agent token. Companion specifications may define additional claims for use by PSes or ASes in policy evaluation — for example, software attestation, platform integrity, secure enclave status, workload identity assertions, or software publisher identity. PSes and ASes MUST ignore unrecognized claims.

### Agent Token Usage

Agents present agent tokens via the `Signature-Key` header ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]) using `scheme=jwt`:

```http
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;
    jwt="eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6Im..."
```

### Agent Token Verification

Verify the agent token per [@!RFC7515] and [@!RFC7519]:

1. Decode the JWT header. Verify `typ` is `aa-agent+jwt`.
2. Verify `dwk` is `aauth-agent.json`. Discover the issuer's JWKS via `{iss}/.well-known/{dwk}` per the HTTP Signature Keys specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). Locate the key matching the JWT header `kid` and verify the JWT signature.
3. Verify `exp` is in the future and `iat` is not in the future.
4. Verify `iss` is a valid HTTPS URL conforming to the Server Identifier requirements.
5. Verify `cnf.jwk` matches the key used to sign the HTTP request.
6. If `ps` is present, verify it is a valid HTTPS URL conforming to the Server Identifier requirements.
7. If `parent_agent` is present, verify it is a valid agent identifier — the parent agent. Its presence marks this as a sub-agent's token (#sub-agents); the PS additionally enforces the single-level rule (#sub-agents) when such a token signs a request.

# Resource Access and Resource Tokens {#resource-tokens}

This section defines how agents request access to resources and how resources issue resource tokens.

A resource token can be returned in two ways:

1. **Authorization endpoint**: The agent proactively requests access at the resource's `authorization_endpoint`. The resource responds with a resource token.
2. **AAuth-Requirement challenge**: The agent calls a resource endpoint directly. If the agent lacks sufficient authorization, the resource returns `401` with an `AAuth-Requirement` header containing a resource token (#requirement-auth-token).

A resource MAY return a `401` with `AAuth-Requirement` even when the agent presents a valid auth token — for example, when the endpoint requires additional scopes or a different authorization context beyond what the current auth token grants (nested authorization).

A resource token is a signed JWT that cryptographically binds the resource's identity, the agent's identity, and the requested scope. The resource sets the token's audience based on its configuration:

- If the resource has its own AS: `aud` = AS URL (four-party)
- If the resource has no AS but the agent has a PS (`ps` claim in agent token): `aud` = PS URL (three-party)
- If neither: the resource handles authorization itself — via an interaction response (#user-interaction) or internal policy — and MAY return an `AAuth-Access` header (#aauth-access)

A resource MAY always handle authorization itself, regardless of whether the agent has a PS.

## Authorization Endpoint Request

A resource MAY publish an `authorization_endpoint` in its metadata. The agent sends a signed POST to the authorization endpoint. The resource reads the agent token from the `Signature-Key` header and determines how to respond — it may return a resource token, handle authorization itself, or both.

**Request parameters:**

- `scope` (REQUIRED): A space-separated string of scope values the agent is requesting.

```http
POST /authorize HTTP/1.1
Host: resource.example
Content-Type: application/json
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "scope": "data.read data.write"
}
```

When the agent is operating in a mission context, it includes the `AAuth-Mission` header and adds `aauth-mission` to the signed components:

```http
POST /authorize HTTP/1.1
Host: resource.example
Content-Type: application/json
AAuth-Mission:
    approver="https://ps.example";
    s256="dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk"
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key"
    "aauth-mission");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "scope": "data.read data.write"
}
```

## Authorization Endpoint Responses

The resource can handle authorization itself, or it can issue a resource token when the resource has an AS or the agent token includes a `ps` claim.

### Response without Resource Token

The resource handles authorization itself. It evaluates the request and returns a deferred response if user interaction is needed:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://resource.example/authorize/pending/abc123
Retry-After: 0
Cache-Control: no-store
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=interaction;
    url="https://resource.example/interaction"; code="A1B2-C3D4"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "pending"
}
```

The user completes interaction at the resource's own consent page. The agent polls the `Location` URL. When authorization is complete, the resource returns `200 OK` and MAY include an `AAuth-Access` header (#aauth-access) containing an opaque access token for subsequent calls.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
AAuth-Access: wrapped-opaque-token-value
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "authorized",
  "scope": "data.read data.write"
}
```

If the resource can authorize immediately (e.g., the agent's key is already authorized), it returns `200 OK` directly with the optional `AAuth-Access` header.

### Response with Resource Token

Alternatively, the resource MAY return a resource token. The resource sets the `aud` claim based on its configuration:

- If the resource has its own AS: `aud` = AS URL (four-party)
- If the resource has no AS but the agent has a PS (`ps` claim): `aud` = PS URL (three-party)

When the `AAuth-Mission` header is present, the resource includes the mission reference (`approver` and `s256`) in the resource token.

```json
{
  "resource_token": "eyJhbGc..."
}
```

The agent sends the resource token to its PS's token endpoint.

### Authorization Endpoint Error Responses

| Error | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `invalid_request` | 400 | Missing or invalid parameters |
| `invalid_signature` | 401 | HTTP signature verification failed |
| `invalid_scope` | 400 | Requested scope not recognized by the resource |
| `server_error` | 500 | Internal error |

Error responses use the same format as the token endpoint (#error-response-format).

## Agent Token Required {#requirement-agent-token}

A resource that requires only the agent's identity — identity-based access, with no user auth token — uses `requirement=agent-token` with a `401 Unauthorized` response when the request did not present an AAuth agent token. This signals that the resource specifically requires an AAuth agent token (`typ: aa-agent+jwt`), as distinct from any other URI-identified signing key.

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=agent-token
```

The header carries no additional parameters: the agent already holds its agent token and need only present it. The agent retries the request, signing it per (#http-message-signatures-profile) and presenting its agent token via the `Signature-Key` header using `sig=jwt;jwt="<agent-token>"`.

`requirement=agent-token` is distinct from `requirement=auth-token`: the former asks for the agent's own identity token, with no PS or AS involved; the latter asks the agent to obtain an auth token from its PS using the enclosed resource token. It is also more specific than an `Accept-Signature` challenge ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]), which accepts any URI-identified key — `requirement=agent-token` tells the agent that an AAuth agent token in particular is required.

## AAuth-Access Response Header {#aauth-access}

The `AAuth-Access` response header carries an opaque access token from a resource to an agent. The token is opaque to the agent — the resource wraps its internal authorization state (which MAY be an existing OAuth access token or other credential). The agent passes the token back to the resource via the `Authorization` header on subsequent requests:

```http
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: resource.example
Authorization: AAuth wrapped-opaque-token-value
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority" "@path" \
    "authorization" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."
```

The agent MUST include `authorization` in the covered components of its HTTP signature, binding the access token to the signed request. This prevents the token from being stolen and replayed as a standalone bearer token — the token is useless without a valid AAuth signature from the agent.

A resource MAY return a new `AAuth-Access` header on any response, replacing the agent's current access token. This enables rolling refresh without an explicit refresh flow. When the agent receives a new `AAuth-Access` value, it MUST use the new value on subsequent requests.

The `AAuth-Access` value, and the credential carried in `Authorization: AAuth`, is a `token68` ([@!RFC9110], Section 11.2). Recipients MUST reject empty values, values containing embedded whitespace or control characters, and responses carrying more than one credential.

## Resource-Managed Authorization {#resource-managed-auth}

When a resource manages authorization itself and requires user interaction, it returns a `202 Accepted` response with an interaction requirement:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://resource.example/pending/abc123
Retry-After: 0
Cache-Control: no-store
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=interaction;
    url="https://resource.example/interaction"; code="A1B2-C3D4"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "pending"
}
```

The agent directs the user to the interaction URL (#user-interaction) and polls the `Location` URL per the deferred response pattern (#deferred-responses). When the interaction completes, the resource returns `200 OK` and MAY include an `AAuth-Access` header (#aauth-access) with an opaque access token for subsequent calls.

A resource MAY also authorize the agent based solely on its identity (from the agent token) without any interaction — for example, when the agent's key is already known or the agent's domain is trusted.

## Auth Token Required {#requirement-auth-token}

A resource MUST use `requirement=auth-token` with a `401 Unauthorized` response when an auth token is required. The header MUST include a `resource-token` parameter containing a resource token JWT (#resource-token-structure).

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=auth-token; resource-token="eyJ..."
```

The agent MUST extract the `resource-token` parameter, verify the resource token (#resource-challenge-verification), and present it to its PS's token endpoint to obtain an auth token (#ps-token-endpoint). A resource MAY also use `402 Payment Required` with the same `AAuth-Requirement` header when payment is additionally required (#requirement-responses).

A resource MAY return `requirement=auth-token` with a new resource token to a request that already includes an auth token — for example, when the request requires a higher level of authorization than the current token provides. Agents MUST be prepared for this step-up authorization at any time.

## Resource Token

### Resource Token Structure

A resource token is a JWT with `typ: aa-resource+jwt` containing:

Header:
- `alg`: Signing algorithm. EdDSA is RECOMMENDED. Implementations MUST NOT accept `none`.
- `typ`: `aa-resource+jwt`
- `kid`: Key identifier

Payload:
- `iss`: Resource URL
- `dwk`: `aauth-resource.json` — the well-known metadata document name for key discovery ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key])
- `aud`: Token audience — the PS URL (when the resource delegates authorization to the agent's PS) or the AS URL (when the resource has its own access server)
- `jti`: Unique token identifier for replay detection, audit, and revocation
- `agent`: Agent identifier
- `agent_jkt`: JWK Thumbprint ([@!RFC7638]) of the agent's current signing key
- `iat`: Issued at timestamp
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp
- `scope`: Requested scopes, as a space-separated string of scope values. Companion specifications MAY define alternative authorization claims that replace `scope`.

Optional payload claims:
- `mission`: Mission reference (present when the resource is mission-aware and the agent sent an `AAuth-Mission` header). Contains:
  - `approver`: HTTPS URL of the entity that approved the mission
  - `s256`: SHA-256 hash of the approved mission JSON (base64url)
- `interaction`: Present when the resource requires its own user-facing flow — for example, obtaining OAuth authorization from a third-party service — before the PS can issue an auth token. Contains:
  - `url`: HTTPS URL of the resource's interaction endpoint
  - `code`: Interaction code to present at that URL

Resource tokens SHOULD NOT have a lifetime exceeding 5 minutes. The `jti` claim provides an audit trail for token requests; ASes are not required to enforce replay detection on resource tokens. If a resource token expires before the PS presents it to the AS (e.g., because user interaction was required), the agent MUST obtain a fresh resource token from the resource and submit a new token request to the PS. The PS SHOULD remember prior consent decisions within a mission so the user is not re-prompted when the agent resubmits a request for the same resource and scope.

### Resource Token Verification

Verify the resource token per [@!RFC7515] and [@!RFC7519]:

1. Decode the JWT header. Verify `typ` is `aa-resource+jwt`.
2. Verify `dwk` is `aauth-resource.json`. Discover the issuer's JWKS via `{iss}/.well-known/{dwk}` per the HTTP Signature Keys specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). Locate the key matching the JWT header `kid` and verify the JWT signature.
3. Verify `exp` is in the future and `iat` is not in the future.
4. Verify `aud` matches the recipient's own identifier (the PS in three-party, or the AS in four-party).
5. Verify `agent` matches the requesting agent's identifier.
6. Verify `agent_jkt` matches the JWK Thumbprint of the key used to sign the HTTP request.
7. If `mission` is present, verify `mission.approver` matches the PS that sent the token request.

For a parent-mediated sub-agent authorization (a `subagent_token` is present, see (#sub-agents)), step 6 instead verifies `agent_jkt` against the `subagent_token`'s `cnf.jwk` — the sub-agent's key — because the parent, not the sub-agent, signs the HTTP request.

### Resource Challenge Verification

When an agent receives a `401` response with `AAuth-Requirement: requirement=auth-token`:

1. Extract the `resource-token` parameter.
2. Decode and verify the resource token JWT.
3. Verify `iss` matches the resource the agent sent the request to.
4. Verify `agent` matches the agent's own identifier.
5. Verify `agent_jkt` matches the JWK Thumbprint of the agent's signing key.
6. Verify `exp` is in the future.
7. Send the resource token to the agent's PS's token endpoint.

# Person Server {#person-server}

This section defines how agents obtain authorization from their person server. When accessing a remote resource, the agent sends a resource token to the PS's token endpoint. When performing local actions not governed by a remote resource, the agent requests permission from the PS's permission endpoint. In both cases, the PS evaluates the request against mission scope, handles user consent if needed, and uses the same requirement response patterns.

## PS Token Endpoint {#ps-token-endpoint}

The PS's `token_endpoint` is where agents send token requests. The PS evaluates the request, handles user consent if needed, and either issues the auth token directly or federates with the resource's AS.

### Token Endpoint Modes

| Mode | Key Parameters | Use Case |
|------|----------------|----------|
| PS-asserted | `resource_token` (`aud` = PS) | PS asserts identity and consent; resource applies its own policy (three-party) |
| AS-federated | `resource_token` (`aud` = AS) | PS federates with the resource's AS, which evaluates resource policy (four-party) |
| Call chaining | `resource_token` + `upstream_token` | Resource acting as agent |

### Concurrent Token Requests

An agent MAY have multiple token requests pending at the PS simultaneously — for example, when a mission requires access to several resources. Each request has its own pending URL and lifecycle. The PS MUST handle concurrent requests independently. Some requests may be resolved without user interaction (e.g., within existing mission scope), while others may require consent. The PS is responsible for managing concurrent user interactions — for example, by batching consent prompts or serializing them.

### Agent Token Request

The agent MUST make a signed POST to the PS's `token_endpoint`. The request MUST include an HTTP Sig (#http-message-signatures-profile) and the agent MUST present its agent token via the `Signature-Key` header using `scheme=jwt`.

**Request parameters:**

- `resource_token` (REQUIRED): The resource token.
- `upstream_token` (OPTIONAL): An auth token from an upstream authorization, used in call chaining (#call-chaining).
- `subagent_token` (OPTIONAL): A sub-agent's agent token, present when a parent agent requests authorization on behalf of one of its sub-agents (#sub-agents). The signing agent (the parent) MUST be named by the `subagent_token`'s `parent_agent`.
- `justification` (OPTIONAL): A Markdown string declaring why access is being requested. The PS SHOULD present this value to the user during consent. The PS MUST sanitize the Markdown before rendering to users. The PS MAY log the `justification` for audit and monitoring purposes. **TODO:** Define recommended sections.
- `login_hint` (OPTIONAL): Hint about who to authorize, per [@!OpenID.Core] Section 3.1.2.1.
- `tenant` (OPTIONAL): Tenant identifier, per OpenID Connect Enterprise Extensions 1.0 [@OpenID.Enterprise].
- `domain_hint` (OPTIONAL): Domain hint, per OpenID Connect Enterprise Extensions 1.0 [@OpenID.Enterprise].
- `prompt` (OPTIONAL): Space-delimited, case-sensitive list of values specifying whether the PS prompts the user for reauthentication and consent, per [@!OpenID.Core] Section 3.1.2.1. Defined values: `none`, `login`, `consent`, `select_account`.
- `platform` (OPTIONAL): Identifier for the runtime platform the agent runs on. The value MUST be from the AAuth Platform Value Registry (#aauth-platform-value-registry). Describes the runtime context (where the agent runs) but does not by itself convey what security measures were applied within that context. Used for display at the PS consent screen and the PS's connected-agents dashboard. Agent-attested.
- `device` (OPTIONAL): Short human-readable string identifying the specific device or browser, intended for display so users can distinguish entries in their connected-agents dashboard (e.g., `Chrome on macOS`, `Pixel 8 (App)`). The string is opaque to receivers — they display it but do not parse it. The string MUST consist of UTF-8 printable characters only (no control characters) and MUST NOT exceed 64 characters. Agents MUST NOT include personally identifying information beyond what the user has chosen (e.g., user-supplied nicknames). Agent-attested.
- `capabilities` (OPTIONAL): An array of capability values (#aauth-capabilities) the agent can handle for this request — the request-body equivalent of the `AAuth-Capabilities` header, which is not used on PS endpoints. Without a mission, this is how the PS learns the agent's capabilities (for example, whether the agent can drive `requirement=interaction`). Within a mission, `capabilities` is OPTIONAL: if omitted, the PS uses the values captured at mission approval (#mission-approval); if present, it refreshes them for this request.

**Example request:**
```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: ps.example
Content-Type: application/json
Prefer: wait=45
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "resource_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "justification": "Find available meeting times"
}
```

### PS Response

When the resource token's `aud` matches the PS's own identifier (three-party), the PS handles user consent for the requested scope and issues an auth token asserting identity and consent — no AS federation is needed. When `aud` identifies a different server (four-party), the PS federates with the AS per (#ps-as-federation).

In both cases, the PS handles user consent if needed and returns one of:

**Direct grant response** (`200`):
```json
{
  "auth_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

**User interaction required response** (`202`):
```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /pending/abc123
Retry-After: 0
Cache-Control: no-store
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=interaction;
    url="https://ps.example/interaction"; code="A1B2-C3D4"
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "pending"
}
```

In four-party mode, the PS may also pass through a clarification from the AS to the agent via the `202` response (#as-token-endpoint).

### Resource-Initiated Interaction {#resource-initiated-interaction}

When the resource token contains an `interaction` claim, the resource requires its own user-facing flow — typically an OAuth authorization from a third-party service — before authorization can proceed. The PS coordinates this by chaining the resource's flow with its own consent step.

The PS resolves the resource interaction before presenting its own consent: if the user declines the resource's underlying authorization, the PS authorization is vacuous, so it makes no sense to ask for PS consent first.

**Flow:**

1. The PS returns `202` to the agent with its own interaction URL — the same as for any consent interaction.
2. The user arrives at the PS's interaction page. The PS shows an interstitial informing the user that the resource requires additional permissions before the PS can authorize access.
3. The PS redirects the user to the resource's interaction endpoint using the standard callback pattern, where `ps_callback_url` is a PS-generated, per-flow URL: `{interaction.url}?code={interaction.code}&callback={ps_callback_url}`
4. The resource completes its own OAuth or permission flow. The resource MUST redirect the user to the `callback` URL when its flow completes — either successfully or with an error per (#interaction-callback-errors).
5. The PS receives the callback redirect. If the callback contains an `error` parameter, the PS abandons the authorization and returns the mapped polling error to the agent. Otherwise it continues with its own consent step.
6. Upon user approval, the PS issues the auth token and resolves the agent's pending request.

A resource's interaction endpoint MUST support the standard `?code=...&callback=...` pattern regardless of whether the redirect comes from an agent or from a PS in a chained flow — the endpoint cannot and need not distinguish callers.

The `interaction.url` MUST be an HTTPS URL. The PS MUST validate this before constructing the redirect and MUST apply its egress admission policy to the URL.

## User Interaction

When a server responds with `202` and `AAuth-Requirement: requirement=interaction`, the agent directs the user to the interaction `url`/`code` — optionally relaying through its PS first — using the mechanics defined in (#requirement-responses) and (#interaction-relay). Two details specific to the agent directing the user itself:

When the agent has a browser, it MAY append a `callback` parameter:
```
{url}?code={code}&callback={callback_url}
```

The `callback` URL is constructed from the agent's `callback_endpoint` metadata. When present, the server redirects the user's browser to the `callback` URL after the user completes the action. If no `callback` parameter is provided, the server displays a completion page and the agent relies on polling to detect completion.

The `code` parameter is single-use: once the user arrives at the URL with a valid code, the code is consumed and cannot be reused.

When the interaction completes with an error, the server redirects to the `callback` URL with an `error` query parameter instead of signaling success. See (#interaction-callback-errors).

### Interaction Callback Errors {#interaction-callback-errors}

When an interaction cannot be completed successfully, the server MUST redirect to the `callback` URL with an `error` query parameter:

```
{callback_url}?error={error_code}
```

| Error | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `access_denied` | The user explicitly declined the interaction. |
| `user_abandoned` | The user opened the interaction but did not complete it — no explicit decision was made. |
| `server_error` | The party handling the interaction encountered an internal failure. |
| `temporarily_unavailable` | The interaction service is temporarily unavailable; the caller MAY retry. |
| `interaction_expired` | The interaction session expired before the user completed the flow. |

Recipients of a callback with an `error` parameter MUST NOT treat the pending request as completable and MUST surface the error to the caller. In the resource-initiated interaction flow (#resource-initiated-interaction), the PS maps the received callback error to a polling error returned to the agent: `access_denied` maps to `denied`; `user_abandoned` maps to `abandoned`; `interaction_expired` maps to `expired`; `server_error` and `temporarily_unavailable` map to `server_error`.

## Clarification Chat

During user consent, the user may ask questions about the agent's stated justification. The PS delivers these questions to the agent, and the agent responds. This enables a consent dialog without requiring the agent to have a direct channel to the user.

Agents that support clarification chat declare this via the `AAuth-Capabilities` request header (#aauth-capabilities) by including the `clarification` capability value.

### Clarification Required {#requirement-clarification}

A server MUST use `requirement=clarification` with a `202 Accepted` response when it needs the recipient to answer a question before proceeding. The response body MUST include a `clarification` field containing the question and MAY include `timeout` and `options` fields.

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /pending/abc123
Retry-After: 0
Cache-Control: no-store
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=clarification
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "pending",
  "clarification": "Why do you need write access to my calendar?",
  "timeout": 120
}
```

Body fields:

- `clarification` (REQUIRED): A Markdown string containing the question.
- `timeout` (OPTIONAL): Seconds until the server times out the request. The recipient MUST respond before this deadline.
- `options` (OPTIONAL): An array of string values when the question has discrete choices.

The recipient MUST respond with one of the actions defined in (#agent-response-to-clarification): a clarification response, an updated request, or a cancellation. This requirement is used by both PSes (delivering user questions to agents) and ASes (requesting clarification from PSes).

### Agent Response to Clarification

The agent MUST respond to a clarification with one of:

1. **Clarification response**: POST a `clarification_response` to the pending URL.
2. **Updated request**: POST a new `resource_token` to the pending URL, replacing the original request with updated scope or parameters.
3. **Cancel request**: DELETE the pending URL to withdraw the request.

#### Clarification Response

The agent responds by POSTing JSON with `clarification_response` to the pending URL:

```http
POST /pending/abc123 HTTP/1.1
Host: ps.example
Content-Type: application/json
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "clarification_response":
    "I need to create a meeting invite
     for the participants you listed."
}
```

The `clarification_response` value is a Markdown string. **TODO:** Define recommended sections. After posting, the agent resumes polling with `GET`.

#### Updated Request

The agent MAY obtain a new resource token from the resource (e.g., with reduced scope) and POST it to the pending URL:

```http
POST /pending/abc123 HTTP/1.1
Host: ps.example
Content-Type: application/json
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "resource_token": "eyJ...",
  "justification": "I've reduced my request to read-only access."
}
```

The new resource token MUST have the same `iss`, `agent`, and `agent_jkt` as the original. The PS presents the updated request to the user. A `justification` is OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED to explain the change to the user.

#### Cancel Request

The agent MAY cancel the request by sending DELETE to the pending URL:

```http
DELETE /pending/abc123 HTTP/1.1
Host: ps.example
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."
```

The PS terminates the consent session and informs the user that the agent withdrew its request. Subsequent requests to the pending URL return `410 Gone`.

### Clarification Limits

PSes SHOULD enforce limits on clarification rounds (recommended: 5 rounds maximum). Clarification responses from agents are untrusted input and MUST be sanitized before display to the user.

## Permission Endpoint {#permission-endpoint}

The permission endpoint enables agents to request permission from the PS for actions not governed by a remote resource — for example, executing tool calls, writing files, or sending messages on behalf of the user. This enables governance before any resources support AAuth. The permission endpoint MAY be used with or without a mission.

When a mission is active, the mission approval MAY include a list of pre-approved tools in the `approved_tools` field. The agent calls the permission endpoint only for actions not covered by pre-approved tools.

### Permission Request

The agent MUST make a signed POST to the PS's `permission_endpoint`. The request MUST include an HTTP Sig (#http-message-signatures-profile) and the agent MUST present its agent token via the `Signature-Key` header.

**Request parameters:**

- `action` (REQUIRED): A string identifying the action the agent wants to perform (e.g., a tool name).
- `description` (OPTIONAL): A Markdown string describing what the action will do and why.
- `parameters` (OPTIONAL): A JSON object containing the parameters the agent intends to pass to the action.
- `mission` (OPTIONAL): Mission reference with `approver` and `s256` fields, binding the request to a mission. When present, the PS evaluates the request against the mission context and log history.

```http
POST /permission HTTP/1.1
Host: ps.example
Content-Type: application/json
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority" "@path" \
    "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "action": "SendEmail",
  "description": "Send the proposed itinerary to the user",
  "parameters": {
    "to": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Japan trip itinerary"
  },
  "mission": {
    "approver": "https://ps.example",
    "s256": "dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk"
  }
}
```

### Permission Response

If the PS can decide immediately, it returns `200 OK`:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "permission": "granted"
}
```

The `permission` field is one of:

- `granted`: The agent MAY proceed with the action.
- `denied`: The agent MUST NOT proceed. The response MAY include a `reason` field with a Markdown string explaining why.

If the mission is no longer active, the PS returns a mission status error (#mission-status-errors).

If the PS requires user input, it returns a deferred response (#deferred-responses) using the same pattern as other AAuth endpoints. The agent polls until the PS returns a final response.

The PS SHOULD record all permission requests and responses. When a mission is present, the PS records the permission request and response in the mission log.

## Audit Endpoint {#audit-endpoint}

The audit endpoint enables agents to log actions they have performed, providing the PS with a record for governance and monitoring. The agent sends a signed POST to the PS's `audit_endpoint` after performing an action. The audit endpoint requires a mission — there is no audit outside a mission context.

### Audit Request

The agent MUST make a signed POST to the PS's `audit_endpoint`. The request MUST include an HTTP Sig (#http-message-signatures-profile) and the agent MUST present its agent token via the `Signature-Key` header.

**Request parameters:**

- `mission` (REQUIRED): Mission reference with `approver` and `s256` fields.
- `action` (REQUIRED): A string identifying the action that was performed.
- `description` (OPTIONAL): A Markdown string describing what was done and the outcome.
- `parameters` (OPTIONAL): A JSON object containing the parameters that were used.
- `result` (OPTIONAL): A JSON object containing the result or outcome of the action.

```http
POST /audit HTTP/1.1
Host: ps.example
Content-Type: application/json
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority" "@path" \
    "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "mission": {
    "approver": "https://ps.example",
    "s256": "dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk"
  },
  "action": "WebSearch",
  "description": "Searched for flights to Tokyo in May",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "flights to Tokyo May 2026"
  },
  "result": {
    "status": "completed",
    "summary": "Found 12 flight options"
  }
}
```

### Audit Response

The PS returns `201 Created` to acknowledge the record:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

The audit endpoint is fire-and-forget — the agent SHOULD NOT block on the response. The PS records the audit entry in the mission log. The PS MAY use audit records to detect anomalous behavior, alert the user, or revoke the mission.

If the mission is no longer active, the PS returns a mission status error (#mission-status-errors).

## Interaction Endpoint {#interaction-endpoint}

The interaction endpoint enables the agent to reach the user through the PS. The agent uses this endpoint to forward interaction requirements from resources that it cannot handle directly, to ask the user questions, to relay payment approvals, or to propose mission completion. The `interaction_endpoint` URL is published in the PS's well-known metadata (#ps-metadata). The interaction endpoint MAY be used with or without a mission.

### Interaction Request

The agent MUST make a signed POST to the PS's `interaction_endpoint`. The request MUST include an HTTP Sig (#http-message-signatures-profile) and the agent MUST present its agent token via the `Signature-Key` header.

**Request parameters:**

- `type` (REQUIRED): The type of interaction. One of `interaction`, `payment`, `question`, or `completion`.
- `description` (OPTIONAL): A Markdown string providing context for the user.
- `url` (OPTIONAL): The interaction URL to relay to the user (for `interaction` and `payment` types).
- `code` (OPTIONAL): The interaction code associated with the URL.
- `max_wait` (OPTIONAL): Maximum seconds the PS SHOULD hold the relay's deferred response before resolving it (for `interaction` and `payment` types). When the interaction URL is resource-hosted, the PS resolves its deferred response once the user has engaged or when this window elapses, whichever comes first; the agent then relies on the resource's pending URL for completion (#interaction-response-poll-authority). Absent `max_wait`, the PS resolves the relay when the user has engaged or it can make no further progress.
- `question` (OPTIONAL): A Markdown string containing a question for the user (for `question` type).
- `summary` (OPTIONAL): A Markdown string summarizing what the agent accomplished (for `completion` type).
- `mission` (OPTIONAL): Mission reference with `approver` and `s256` fields, binding the request to a mission.

**Relay interaction example:**

```http
POST /interaction HTTP/1.1

  }
}
```

### Interaction Response {#interaction-response-poll-authority}

For `interaction` and `payment` types, the PS relays the interaction to the user and returns a deferred response (#deferred-responses).

When the interaction URL is hosted by the **PS itself**, the PS's deferred response is authoritative for completion: the agent polls it until the user completes the interaction.

When the interaction URL is hosted by a **resource** — the common case for a relayed `interaction`, such as a proxy's OAuth bootstrap page or a merchant's payment-confirmation page — the user completes the interaction at the resource, not at the PS. The agent then holds two pending URLs: the resource's original `Location` (from the resource's `202`) and the PS's relay `Location`. The **resource's** pending URL is authoritative for completion. The PS's relay deferred response reports only that the relay reached the user: it returns `status: "interacting"` (#deferred-responses) once the user has engaged, and a terminal response when the PS has done all it can — the user engaged, the agent's `max_wait` window elapsed, or the PS can make no further progress. The agent MUST treat the resource's pending URL as the signal that the interaction is complete, and continues polling it after the PS relay resolves.

If the PS has no channel available to relay an `interaction` or `payment` to the user, it returns `interaction_unavailable` (#interaction-endpoint-errors). This is the PS declining to relay this specific interaction; the agent falls back to directing the user to the `url`/`code` itself (#interaction-relay). It is distinct from `user_unreachable`: `interaction_unavailable` is non-terminal — the agent can still drive the interaction — whereas `user_unreachable` (#token-endpoint-error-codes) is terminal, meaning no party can reach the user.

For `question` type, the PS delivers the question to the user and returns the answer:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "answer": "Yes, go ahead with the refundable option."
}
```

For `completion` type, the PS presents the summary to the user. The user either accepts — the PS terminates the mission and returns `200 OK` — or responds with follow-up questions via clarification (#clarification-chat), keeping the mission active. The PS returns a deferred response while the user reviews.

If the PS cannot reach the user and the agent does not have the `interaction` capability, the PS returns `user_unreachable` (#token-endpoint-error-codes) — a terminal error, since no party can reach the user. If the mission is no longer active, the PS returns a mission status error (#mission-status-errors). The PS SHOULD record all interaction requests and responses. When a mission is active, the PS records the interaction in the mission log.

### Interaction Endpoint Errors {#interaction-endpoint-errors}

Errors use the token endpoint error response format (#error-response-format).

| Error | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `interaction_unavailable` | 424 | The PS has no channel available to relay this `interaction` or `payment` to the user. Non-terminal: the agent falls back to directing the user to the `url`/`code` itself (#interaction-relay). Distinct from the terminal `user_unreachable` (#token-endpoint-error-codes). |

## Re-authorization

AAuth does not have a separate refresh token or refresh flow. When an auth token expires, the agent obtains a fresh resource token from the resource's authorization endpoint and submits it to the PS's token endpoint — the same flow as the initial authorization. This gives the resource a voice in every re-authorization: the resource can adjust scope, require step-up authorization, or deny access based on current policy.

When an agent rotates its signing key, all existing auth tokens are bound to the old key and can no longer be used. The agent MUST re-authorize by obtaining fresh resource tokens and submitting them to the PS.

Agents SHOULD proactively obtain a new agent token and refresh all auth tokens before the current agent token expires, to avoid service interruptions. Auth tokens MUST NOT have an `exp` value that exceeds the `exp` of the agent token used to obtain them — a resource MUST reject an auth token whose associated agent token has expired.

# Mission {#missions}

Missions are OPTIONAL. The protocol operates in all modes without missions. When used, missions provide scoped authorization contexts that guide an agent's work across multiple resource accesses — enabling scope pre-approval, reduced consent fatigue, and centralized audit. A mission is a natural-language description of what the agent intends to accomplish, proposed by the agent and approved by the PS. The PS uses the mission to evaluate every subsequent request in context — it is the only party with the mission content, the user relationship, and the full history of the agent's actions. Once approved, the mission's `s256` identifier is included in subsequent resource interactions via the `AAuth-Mission` header.

## Mission Creation {#mission-creation}

The agent creates a mission by sending a proposal to the PS's `mission_endpoint`. The agent MUST make a signed POST with an HTTP Sig (#http-message-signatures-profile), presenting its agent token via the `Signature-Key` header using `scheme=jwt`.

The proposal includes a Markdown description of what the agent intends to accomplish, and MAY include a list of tools the agent wants to use:

```json
{
  "description": "# Plan Japan Vacation\n\n
    Plan and book a trip to Japan next month
    for 2 adults. Budget around $5k.
    Propose an itinerary before booking.",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "WebSearch",
      "description": "Search the web"
    },
    {
      "name": "BookFlight",
      "description": "Book flights"
    },
    {
      "name": "BookHotel",
      "description": "Book hotels"
    }
  ]
}
```

The PS MAY return a `202 Accepted` deferred response (#deferred-responses) if human review, clarification, or approval is needed. During this phase, the PS and user may engage in clarification chat (#clarification-chat) with the agent to refine the mission scope, ask questions about the agent's intent, or negotiate which tools are needed. The PS or user may also modify the description — the approved mission MAY differ from the original proposal.

## Mission Approval {#mission-approval}

When the PS approves the mission, the response body is a JSON object — the **mission blob** — containing the approved mission and session-specific information. The PS returns the `AAuth-Mission` header with the `approver` and `s256` values:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
AAuth-Mission: approver="https://ps.example";
    s256="dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk"

{
  "approver": "https://ps.example",
  "agent": "aauth:assistant@agent.example",
  "approved_at": "2026-04-07T14:30:00Z",
  "description": "# Plan Japan Vacation\n\n
    Plan and book a trip to Japan next month
    for 2 adults. Budget around $5k.
    Propose an itinerary before booking.",
  "approved_tools": [
    {
      "name": "WebSearch",
      "description": "Search the web"
    },
    {
      "name": "Read",
      "description": "Read files and web pages"
    }
  ],
  "capabilities": [
    "interaction",
    "payment"
  ]
}
```

The mission blob MUST include:

- `approver`: HTTPS URL of the entity that approved the mission. Currently this is always the PS.
- `agent`: The agent identifier (`aauth:local@domain`).
- `approved_at`: ISO 8601 timestamp of when the mission was approved. Ensures the `s256` is globally unique.
- `description`: Markdown string describing the approved mission scope.

The mission blob MAY include:

- `approved_tools`: Array of tool objects (each with `name` and `description`) that the agent may use without per-call permission at the PS's permission endpoint (#permission-endpoint).
- `capabilities`: Array of capability strings (e.g., `interaction`, `payment`) that the PS can provide on behalf of the user for this session. The PS determines these based on whether it can reach the specific user — for example, via push notification, email, or an active session. The agent unions these with its own capabilities when constructing the `AAuth-Capabilities` request header (#aauth-capabilities).

The response body — the mission blob — is the mission JSON that `s256` hashes everywhere it appears (the `AAuth-Mission` header and the `mission` reference in resource and auth tokens). The `s256` is the base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash of the response body bytes. The agent verifies the hash by computing SHA-256 over the exact response body bytes, and MUST store those bytes exactly as received — no re-serialization.

The approved description MAY differ from the proposal — the PS or user may refine, constrain, or expand the mission during review. The approved tools MAY be a subset of the proposed tools. The agent MUST use the `approver` and `s256` from the `AAuth-Mission` header in all subsequent `AAuth-Mission` request headers.

## Mission Log {#mission-log}

The approved mission description is immutable — the `s256` hash binds it permanently. Missions do not change; they accumulate context.

All agent interactions with the PS within a mission context form the **mission log**: token requests (with justifications), permission requests and responses, audit records, interaction requests, and clarification chats. The PS maintains this log as an ordered record of the agent's actions and the governance decisions made. The mission log gives the PS the full history it needs to evaluate whether each new request is consistent with the mission's intent.

The agent includes the mission context in all resource interactions via the `AAuth-Mission` header. When the agent sends a resource token to its PS, the PS evaluates the request against the mission context and log history before federating with the resource's AS.

## Mission Completion {#mission-completion}

When the agent believes the mission is complete, it sends a `completion` interaction to the PS's interaction endpoint (#interaction-endpoint) with a summary of what was accomplished. The PS presents the summary to the user. The user either accepts — the PS terminates the mission — or responds with follow-up questions via clarification, keeping the mission active. This is the most common mission lifecycle path.

## Mission Management

A mission has one of two states:

- **active**: The mission is in progress. The agent can make requests against it.
- **terminated**: The mission is permanently ended. The PS MUST reject requests with `mission_terminated`.

The mechanisms for state transitions beyond completion — revocation, delegation tree queries, and administrative interfaces — will be defined in a companion specification.

## Mission Status Errors {#mission-status-errors}

When an agent makes a request to any PS endpoint with a `mission` parameter referencing a mission that is no longer active, the PS MUST return an error:

```http
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "mission_terminated",
  "mission_status": "terminated"
}
```

| Error | Mission Status | Meaning |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `mission_terminated` | `terminated` | The mission is permanently ended. The agent MUST stop acting on this mission. |

## AAuth-Mission Request Header

The `AAuth-Mission` header is a request header sent by the agent on initial requests to a resource when operating in a mission context. It signals to the resource that the agent has a person server and is operating within a mission.

```http
AAuth-Mission:
    approver="https://ps.example";
    s256="dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk"
```

Parameters:

- `approver`: The HTTPS URL of the entity that approved the mission
- `s256`: The base64url-encoded SHA-256 hash of the approved mission JSON

When a mission-aware resource receives a request with the `AAuth-Mission` header, it includes the mission reference (`approver` and `s256`) in the resource token it issues. When a resource does not support missions, it ignores the header.

Agents operating in a mission context MUST include the `AAuth-Mission` header on requests to resources that do not include an auth token containing a `mission` claim.

`AAuth-Mission` carries a *mission reference* — the `{approver, s256}` pair — not the mission body. A resource or AS MUST NOT dereference the reference to fetch the mission blob; the full mission JSON is held only by the agent and the PS (#mission-approval). A mission-aware resource copies the reference into the resource token's `mission` claim unchanged; downstream parties receive mission semantics through resource/auth token claims and PS evaluation, never by resolving the blob.

- `approver` MUST be an HTTPS URL conforming to the Server Identifier requirements (#server-identifiers) — scheme and host only, no port, path, query, or fragment — and is compared by exact string match.
- `s256` MUST be the unpadded base64url encoding of the 32-byte SHA-256 digest of the approved mission JSON bytes (#mission-approval).

# Access Server Federation {#access-server-federation}

This section defines auth tokens and the mechanisms by which they are issued. The auth token is the end result of the authorization flow — a JWT issued by an access server that grants an agent access to a specific resource. This section covers the AS token endpoint, PS-AS federation, and the auth token structure.

## AS Token Endpoint {#as-token-endpoint}

The AS evaluates resource policy and issues auth tokens. It accepts JSON POST requests.

### PS-to-AS Token Request

The PS MUST make a signed POST to the AS's `token_endpoint`. The PS authenticates via an HTTP Sig (#http-message-signatures-profile).

**Request parameters:**

- `resource_token` (REQUIRED): The resource token issued by the resource.
- `agent_token` (REQUIRED): The agent's agent token. For a parent-mediated sub-agent authorization, this is the parent (top-level) agent's token.
- `subagent_token` (OPTIONAL): A sub-agent's agent token, present when the PS federates a parent-mediated sub-agent authorization (#sub-agents). When present, the AS binds the issued auth token to the sub-agent (verifying `resource_token`'s `agent_jkt` against the `subagent_token`'s `cnf.jwk`) and records the parent — named by the `subagent_token`'s `parent_agent`, which MUST match `agent_token` — in the `act` chain.
- `upstream_token` (OPTIONAL): An auth token from an upstream authorization, used in call chaining (#call-chaining).

**Example request:**
```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: as.resource.example
Content-Type: application/json
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwks_uri;
    jwks_uri="https://ps.example/.well-known/jwks.json"

{
  "resource_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "agent_token": "eyJhbGc..."
}
```

### AS Response

The PS calls the AS token endpoint and follows the standard deferred response loop (#deferred-responses): it handles `202` and `402` responses and continues until it receives a `200` with an auth token or a terminal error.

**Direct grant response** (`200`):
```json
{
  "auth_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

The AS MAY return `202 Accepted` with an `AAuth-Requirement` header indicating what is needed before it can issue an auth token:

- **`requirement=claims`** (#requirement-claims): The AS needs identity claims. The body includes `required_claims`. The PS MUST provide the requested claims (including a directed `sub` identifier for the resource) by POSTing to the `Location` URL. The AS cannot know what claims it needs until it has processed the resource token.
- **`requirement=clarification`** (#requirement-clarification): The AS needs a question answered. The PS triages who answers: itself (if mission context has the answer), the user, or the agent. The PS MAY pass the clarification down to the agent via a `202` response.
- **`requirement=interaction`** (#requirement-responses): The AS requires user interaction — for example, the user must authenticate at the AS to bind their PS, or the resource owner must approve access. The PS directs the user to the AS's interaction URL, or passes the interaction requirement back to the agent.
- **`requirement=approval`** (#requirement-responses): The AS is obtaining approval without requiring user direction.

**Payment required** (`402`):

The AS MAY return `402 Payment Required` when a billing relationship is required before it will issue auth tokens. The `402` response includes payment details per an applicable payment protocol such as x402 [@x402] or the Machine Payment Protocol (MPP) ([@I-D.ryan-httpauth-payment]). The response MUST include a `Location` header for the PS to poll after payment is settled.

```http
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
Location: https://as.resource.example/token/pending/xyz
WWW-Authenticate: Payment id="x7Tg2pLq", method="stripe",
    request="eyJhbW91bnQiOiIxMDAw..."
```

The PS settles payment per the indicated protocol and polls the `Location` URL. When payment is confirmed, the AS continues processing the token request — which may result in a `200` with an auth token, or a further `202` requiring claims, interaction, or approval.

The PS caches the billing relationship per AS. Future token requests from the same PS to the same AS skip the billing step. The payment protocol, settlement mechanism, and billing terms are out of scope for this specification.

### Auth Token Delivery

When the AS issues an auth token (`200` response), the PS MUST verify the auth token before returning it to the agent:

1. Verify the auth token JWT signature using the AS's JWKS (#jwks-discovery).
2. Verify `iss` matches the AS the PS sent the token request to.
3. Verify `aud` matches the resource identified by the resource token's `iss`.
4. Verify `agent` matches the agent that submitted the token request.
5. Verify `cnf.jwk` matches the agent's signing key.
6. If `act` is present, verify `act.agent` identifies the upstream agent that delegated to the requesting agent, and any nested `act` claims accurately reflect the upstream delegation context.
7. Verify `scope` is consistent with what was requested — not broader than the scope in the resource token.

After verification, the PS returns the auth token to the agent. The agent presents the auth token to the resource via the `Signature-Key` header (#auth-token-usage). The resource verifies the auth token against the AS's JWKS (#auth-token-verification).

The agent receives the auth token from its trusted PS, so signature verification is not strictly required. However, agents SHOULD verify the auth token's signature to detect errors early. Agents MUST verify that `aud`, `cnf`, `agent`, and `act` match their own values.

## Claims Required {#requirement-claims}

A server MUST use `requirement=claims` with a `202 Accepted` response when it needs identity claims to process a request. The response body MUST include a `required_claims` field containing an array of claim names.

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: https://as.resource.example/token/pending/xyz
Retry-After: 0
Cache-Control: no-store
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=claims
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "pending",
  "required_claims": ["email", "tenant"]
}
```

The recipient MUST provide the requested claims (including a directed user identifier as `sub`) by POSTing to the `Location` URL. The recipient MUST include an HTTP Sig (#http-message-signatures-profile) on the POST. Claims not recognized by the recipient SHOULD be ignored. This requirement is used by ASes to request identity claims from PSes during token issuance.

## PS-AS Federation {#ps-as-federation}

The PS is the only entity that calls AS token endpoints. When the PS receives a resource token from an agent, the resource token's `aud` claim identifies where to send the token request. If `aud` matches the PS's own identifier, the PS issues an auth token asserting identity and consent for the requested scope (three-party). If `aud` identifies a different server (an AS), the PS discovers the AS's metadata at `{aud}/.well-known/aauth-access.json` (#access-server-metadata) and calls the AS's `token_endpoint` (#as-token-endpoint) (four-party).

### PS-AS Trust Establishment

Trust between the PS and AS may be pre-established out of band or emerge dynamically from the AS's response to the PS's first token request — AAuth does not require a separate registration step before the protocol can be used. The AS evaluates the token request and responds based on its current policy:

- **Pre-established**: A business relationship configured between the PS and AS, potentially including payment terms, SLA, and compliance requirements. The AS recognizes the PS and processes the token request directly.
- **Interaction**: The AS returns `202` with `requirement=interaction`, directing the user to authenticate at the AS and confirm their PS. After this one-time binding, the AS trusts future requests from that PS for that user. This is the primary mechanism for establishing trust dynamically.
- **Payment**: The AS returns `402`, requiring the PS to establish a billing relationship before tokens will be issued. The PS settles payment per the indicated protocol and polls for completion. After billing is established, the AS trusts future requests from that PS.
- **Claims only**: The AS may trust any PS that can provide sufficient identity claims for a policy decision, without requiring a prior relationship.

These mechanisms may compose: for example, the AS may first require payment (`402`), then interaction for user binding (`202`), then claims (`202`) before issuing an auth token. Each step uses the same `Location` URL for polling.

### AS Decision Logic (Non-Normative) {#as-decision-logic}

The following is a non-normative description of how an AS might evaluate a token request:

1. **PS = AS (same entity)**: Grant directly. The federation call is internal and trust is implicit. See (#ps-as-collapse).
2. **User has bound this PS at the AS**: Apply the user's configured policy for this PS.
3. **PS is pre-established (enterprise agreement)**: Apply the organization's configured policy.
4. **Resource is open or has a free tier**: Grant with restricted scope or rate limits.
5. **Resource requires billing**: Return `402` with payment details.
6. **Resource requires user binding**: Return `202` with `requirement=interaction`.
7. **AS needs identity claims to decide**: Return `202` with `requirement=claims`.
8. **Insufficient trust for requested scope**: Return `403`.

The AS is not required to follow this order. The decision logic is entirely at the AS's discretion based on resource policy.

### Organization Visibility

Organizations benefit from the trust model: an organization's agents share a single PS, and internal resources may share a single AS. The PS provides centralized audit across all agents and missions. Federation is only incurred at the boundary, when an internal agent accesses an external resource. When the same server fills both the PS and AS roles, federation collapses to a single internal evaluation — see (#ps-as-collapse).

### PS-AS Collapse {#ps-as-collapse}

When the agent's PS and the resource's chosen AS are the same server (an instance of role collocation, see (#roles)), federation collapses to a single internal evaluation. This is operationally similar to three-party access — no cross-server hop — but structurally different:

- **Three-party (PS-asserted)**: the resource has no AS; the resource token's `aud` is the PS, and the auth token has `dwk: aauth-person.json`. The resource trusts identity claims and applies its own policy.
- **PS-AS collapse**: the resource has chosen an AS that also operates as the agent's PS; the resource token's `aud` is the AS, and the auth token has `dwk: aauth-access.json`. The resource trusts the AS's policy verdict.

The server applies user consent (its PS responsibility) and resource policy (its AS responsibility) in a single evaluation. Trust between PS and AS is implicit because they are the same entity.

## Auth Token {#auth-tokens}

### Auth Token Structure

An auth token is a JWT with `typ: aa-auth+jwt` containing:

Header:
- `alg`: Signing algorithm. EdDSA is RECOMMENDED. Implementations MUST NOT accept `none`.
- `typ`: `aa-auth+jwt`
- `kid`: Key identifier

Required payload claims:
- `iss`: The URL of the server that issued the auth token — an AS (four-party) or a PS asserting identity (three-party)
- `dwk`: The well-known metadata document name for key discovery ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). `aauth-access.json` when issued by an AS, `aauth-person.json` when issued by a PS.
- `aud`: The URL of the resource the agent is authorized to access.
- `jti`: Unique token identifier for replay detection, audit, and revocation
- `agent`: Agent identifier
- `cnf`: Confirmation claim with `jwk` containing the agent's public key
- `act`: Delegation chain ([@!RFC8693], Section 4.1). OPTIONAL. See (#delegation-chain).
- `iat`: Issued at timestamp
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp. Auth tokens MUST NOT have a lifetime exceeding 1 hour.

Conditional payload claims (at least one MUST be present):
- `sub`: Directed user identifier. An opaque string that identifies the user. The PS SHOULD provide a pairwise pseudonymous identifier per resource (`aud`), preserving user privacy — different resources see different `sub` values for the same user.
- `scope`: Authorized scopes, as a space-separated string of scope values consistent with [@!RFC9068] Section 2.2.3

At least one of `sub` or `scope` MUST be present.

Optional payload claims:
- `mission`: Mission reference. Present when the auth token was issued in the context of a mission. Contains:
  - `approver`: HTTPS URL of the entity that approved the mission
  - `s256`: SHA-256 hash of the approved mission JSON (base64url)
- `tenant`: Tenant identifier per OpenID Connect Enterprise Extensions 1.0 [@OpenID.Enterprise]. When present, `(iss, tenant, sub)` identifies a user within an organization, and `(iss, tenant)` identifies the organization itself.

The auth token MAY include additional claims registered in the IANA JSON Web Token Claims Registry [@!RFC7519] or defined in OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [@!OpenID.Core] Section 5.1.

### Auth Token Usage

Agents present auth tokens via the `Signature-Key` header ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]) using `scheme=jwt`:

```http
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;
    jwt="eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6ImF1dGgr..."
```

Once an auth token has been issued for a resource, the agent presents the auth token (not the agent token) via `Signature-Key` on subsequent requests to that resource. The auth token's `cnf.jwk` is the same key that signed the request, so HTTP Message Signature verification proceeds identically to the agent-token case.

### Auth Token Verification

When a resource receives an auth token, verify per [@!RFC7515] and [@!RFC7519]. A valid JWT signature alone is not a complete AAuth authorization check — both JWT trust and request-context binding must pass.

#### JWT Trust Verification

1. Decode the JWT header. Verify `typ` is `aa-auth+jwt`.
2. Verify `dwk` is `aauth-access.json` (auth token from an AS) or `aauth-person.json` (auth token from a PS asserting identity). Discover the issuer's JWKS via `{iss}/.well-known/{dwk}` per the HTTP Signature Keys specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). Locate the key matching the JWT header `kid` and verify the JWT signature.
3. Verify `exp` is in the future and `iat` is not in the future.
4. Verify `iss` is a valid HTTPS URL.

#### Request-Context Binding

5. Verify `aud` matches the resource's own identifier.
6. Verify `agent` matches the agent identifier from the request's signing context.
7. `cnf.jwk` is REQUIRED. If it is absent, or if its JWK is missing `kty` or the members required for that key type (e.g., `crv` and `x` for OKP keys; `crv`, `x`, and `y` for EC keys; `n` and `e` for RSA keys), reject the token as structurally incomplete before attempting key decoding. If present but not parseable as a supported public key, reject it as invalid key material. Otherwise verify `cnf.jwk` matches the key used to sign the HTTP request.
8. If `act` is present, verify `act.agent` is a valid AAuth agent identifier and accurately reflects the upstream delegation context.
9. Verify that at least one of `sub` or `scope` is present.

### Auth Token Response Verification {#auth-token-response-verification}

When an agent receives an auth token:

1. SHOULD verify the auth token JWT signature using the issuer's JWKS (the AS in four-party, or the PS in three-party). The agent trusts its PS, so signature verification is not required but is RECOMMENDED to detect errors early.
2. Verify `iss` matches the resource token's `aud` claim.
3. Verify `aud` matches the resource the agent intends to access.
4. Verify `cnf.jwk` matches the agent's own signing key.
5. Verify `agent` matches the agent's own identifier.
6. If `act` is present, verify `act.agent` identifies the upstream agent that delegated to this agent.

### Upstream Token Verification {#upstream-token-verification}

When the PS or AS receives an `upstream_token` parameter in a call chaining request:

1. Perform Auth Token Verification (#auth-token-verification) on the upstream token.
2. Verify `iss` is a trusted issuer (a PS or AS whose auth token the recipient previously brokered or is authorized to extend).
3. Verify the `aud` in the upstream token equals the `iss` of the intermediary's agent token (presented in the `Signature-Key` header). This binding confirms the upstream token was issued to the resource now making the downstream request.
4. The PS constructs the `act` claim for the downstream auth token: `act.agent` is set to the intermediary resource's agent identifier, and if the upstream token contained an `act` claim, it is nested inside as the new `act.act`. This preserves the complete upstream delegation chain.
5. The PS evaluates its mission and governance policy based on the upstream token's claims and mission context. The resulting downstream authorization is not required to be a subset of the upstream scopes — see (#call-chaining).

# Agent Delegation {#agent-delegation}

Agent delegation covers the scenarios where more than one agent is involved in fulfilling a request: a resource that acts as an agent to call a downstream resource (call chaining), an orchestrating agent that spawns sub-agents, and the delegation chain recorded in auth tokens that spans both.

## Multi-Hop Resource Access {#multi-hop}

This section defines how resources act as agents (an instance of role collocation, see (#roles)) to access downstream resources on behalf of the original caller. In multi-hop scenarios, a resource that receives an authorized request needs to access another resource to fulfill that request. The resource acts as an agent — it has its own agent identity and signing key — and routes the downstream authorization to obtain an auth token for the downstream resource.

### Call Chaining {#call-chaining}

When a resource needs to access a downstream resource on behalf of the caller, it acts as an agent. The resource determines where to route the downstream token request from the upstream auth token it received — specifically from `mission.approver` (if a mission is present) or from `iss` (the identity of the PS or AS that issued the upstream token). The `ps` claim in the calling agent's agent token is NOT used for this routing; the upstream auth token is the authoritative source.

- **Mission present** (`mission.approver` in the upstream auth token): The resource sends the downstream resource token to the PS identified by `mission.approver`, along with its own agent token and the upstream auth token as the `upstream_token`. The PS has mission context and evaluates the downstream request against the mission scope. This is the governed path — the PS sees the full delegation chain for audit.

- **No mission, `iss` is a PS** (three-party upstream): The upstream auth token was issued directly by the PS (`iss` = PS URL). The resource sends the downstream resource token to that PS, along with its own agent token and the `upstream_token`. The PS evaluates the request without mission context.

- **No mission, `iss` is an AS** (four-party upstream, no governance): The resource sends the downstream resource token to the AS identified by `iss`, along with its own agent token and the `upstream_token`. The AS evaluates the request based on resource policy. No PS is involved — no governance context is available.

To ensure the PS is in the loop for every hop in a chain, the person's PS MUST require a mission. A mission puts `mission.approver` in the upstream auth token, giving every intermediary a PS URL to route to regardless of whether the upstream issuer was a PS or AS.

In every case the intermediary signs the downstream token request with its **own** key, presenting its own agent token via the `Signature-Key` header (#http-message-signatures-profile). The `upstream_token` is a body parameter — it is neither presented via `Signature-Key` nor used as the signing key. It is the auth token previously issued to the intermediary (its `aud` is the intermediary and its `cnf` is the intermediary's key), and it serves only as proof of the upstream authorization that the recipient extends downstream. The signature the recipient verifies is therefore always the intermediary's, over its own key.

The recipient (PS or AS) evaluates the downstream request per (#upstream-token-verification).

Note that downstream authorization is not required to be a subset of the upstream scopes. A downstream resource may have capabilities that are orthogonal to the upstream resource — for example, a flight booking API that calls a payment processor needs the payment processor to charge a card, an operation the user and original agent could never perform directly. The downstream resource's scope is constrained by its own AS policy and the PS's evaluation of the mission context, not by the upstream token's scope. The PS provides the governance constraint — it evaluates each hop independently and can deny requests that fall outside the mission or the user's intent.

Because the resource acts as an agent, it MUST have its own agent identity — it MUST publish agent metadata at `/.well-known/aauth-agent.json` so that downstream resources and ASes can verify its identity.

### Interaction Chaining {#interaction-chaining}

When the PS or AS requires user interaction for the downstream access, it returns a `202` with `requirement=interaction`. Resource 1 chains the interaction back to the original agent by returning its own `202`.

When a resource acting as an agent receives a `202 Accepted` response with `AAuth-Requirement: requirement=interaction`, and the resource needs to propagate this interaction requirement to its caller, it MUST return a `202 Accepted` response to the original agent with its own `AAuth-Requirement` header containing `requirement=interaction` and its own interaction code. The resource MUST provide its own `Location` URL for the original agent to poll. When the user completes interaction and the resource obtains the downstream auth token, the resource completes the original request and returns the result at its pending URL.

## Sub-Agents {#sub-agents}

Agent platforms increasingly spawn short-lived sub-agents — workers or tool-specific helpers — under an orchestrating parent agent. AAuth represents a sub-agent as an agent whose agent token carries a `parent_agent` claim identifying its parent. The user consents to the parent; sub-agents operate under that consent without per-spawn re-prompting, while remaining individually identifiable for audit and revocation.

### Sub-Agent Identity

A sub-agent has its own agent identity — its own `aauth:local@domain` identifier and signing key, issued by the agent provider, exactly like a top-level agent. Two things distinguish it:

- **`parent_agent` claim**: the sub-agent's agent token includes `parent_agent` set to the parent agent's identifier. Its presence is the authoritative marker of sub-agent status.
- **Local-part naming**: the sub-agent's `local` part MUST be the parent's `local` part followed by `+` and a non-empty discriminator (#agent-identifiers) — for example `aauth:planner.7f3c+search1@vendor.example`. For protocol decisions, verifiers rely on `parent_agent`, not on parsing the local part; the naming is for operational readability (e.g., logs).

```json
{
  "iss": "https://vendor.example",
  "dwk": "aauth-agent.json",
  "sub": "aauth:planner.7f3c+search1@vendor.example",
  "cnf": { "jwk": { "kty": "OKP", "crv": "Ed25519", "x": "..." } },
  "ps":  "https://ps.example",
  "parent_agent": "aauth:planner.7f3c@vendor.example"
}
```

Acquisition of a sub-agent token from the agent provider is platform-dependent and is described in [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap], parallel to top-level agent token acquisition.

### Single-Level Depth

The delegation chain is at most one level deep: a top-level agent may have sub-agents, but a sub-agent MUST NOT have sub-agents of its own. Two rules enforce this:

- A PS MUST reject a token request signed by an agent whose agent token has a `parent_agent` claim — a sub-agent cannot request authorization on its own behalf or on behalf of a further sub-agent.
- An agent provider MUST NOT issue a sub-agent token whose parent (`parent_agent`) is itself a sub-agent.

For genuinely deeper workflows, AAuth already provides chained top-level agents (#call-chaining): each hop is an independent principal with its own grant, rather than recursive sub-agent spawning.

### Parent-Mediated Authorization

A sub-agent MUST NOT call the PS directly. Instead, the parent obtains auth tokens on the sub-agent's behalf:

1. The sub-agent calls the resource and obtains a resource token bound to its own key (#resource-tokens), exactly as a top-level agent would. It passes the resource token to its parent out of band (for example, via IPC).
2. The parent POSTs to the PS's `token_endpoint`, signing the request with its own key and presenting its own agent token via the `Signature-Key` header. The request body includes `resource_token` (the sub-agent's resource token) and `subagent_token` (the sub-agent's agent token).
3. The PS processes this as an authorization request from the parent (#ps-token-endpoint):
   - It verifies the HTTP Message Signature against the parent's `cnf.jwk`.
   - It verifies the `subagent_token` (#agent-token-verification) and that its `parent_agent` names the parent — the agent that signed the request.
   - It verifies the `resource_token` is bound to the sub-agent's key: `agent_jkt` matches the `subagent_token`'s `cnf.jwk` (not the signing key) and `agent` matches the sub-agent's identifier (#resource-token-verification).
   - It evaluates the parent's grant for the requested scope, exactly as for a direct request from the parent. If the user has already consented, the response is immediate; otherwise consent surfaces for the parent as usual.
4. On success the issuer — the PS in three-party, or the AS in four-party — issues an auth token bound to the sub-agent's key (`cnf` = the sub-agent's `jwk`, `agent` = the sub-agent's identifier), with `act.agent` set to the parent agent's identifier (taken from the `subagent_token`'s `parent_agent`). If the parent was itself in a delegation chain (e.g., the parent received an `upstream_token`), the parent's upstream `act` chain is nested inside. In four-party, the PS federates by passing the parent as `agent_token` and the sub-agent as `subagent_token` to the AS (#as-token-endpoint), so the AS records the parent authoritatively from those tokens. The parent passes the auth token to the sub-agent, which presents it to the resource signing with its own key.

Because every sub-agent authorization passes through the parent, the parent retains control — it can refuse, attenuate, or rate-limit — and revocation propagates naturally: revoking the parent's grant causes the next sub-agent authorization to fail, while existing auth tokens expire normally (≤1 hour).

## Delegation Chain {#delegation-chain}

The `act` claim records the upstream delegation chain in an auth token. It is OPTIONAL — absent when the agent obtained the auth token directly (no chaining, no sub-agent). When present:

- `act.agent` is the `aauth:` URI of the immediate upstream agent: the intermediary resource in call chaining, or the parent agent in sub-agent authorization.
- If that upstream agent was itself delegated to, its upstream is recorded as a nested `act` claim, and so on.
- AAuth uses `agent` (not RFC 8693's `sub`) as the identifier field within each `act` node, making explicit that the value is an AAuth agent identifier.
- The presenter's own identity is in the top-level `agent` claim and is not repeated inside `act`.

The relationship type — call chain vs sub-agent — is distinguishable from the `+` delimiter in AAuth identifiers without a separate field.

### Delegation Chain Examples {#delegation-chain-examples}

**Just chaining.** A top-level agent `asst` calls `booking`, which acts as an agent to call `payments`. No sub-agents.

```json
// auth token asst presents at booking — direct auth, no act
{ "aud": "booking.example", "sub": "user:alice",
  "agent": "aauth:asst@agent.example" }

// auth token booking presents at payments — booking was delegated by asst
{ "aud": "payments.example", "sub": "user:alice",
  "agent": "aauth:booking@booking.example",
  "act": { "agent": "aauth:asst@agent.example" } }
```

**Just a sub-agent.** The parent `planner.7f3c` mediates; the sub-agent `planner.7f3c+search1` calls `search`. The `+` in the identifier marks the sub-agent relationship.

```json
// auth token search1 presents at search — delegated by its parent
{ "aud": "search.example", "sub": "user:alice",
  "agent": "aauth:planner.7f3c+search1@vendor.example",
  "act": { "agent": "aauth:planner.7f3c@vendor.example" } }
```

**A sub-agent inside a chain.** `asst` calls `booking`; `booking` spawns sub-agent `booking+search1`; `booking+search1` calls `maps`. The `act` chain records both the sub-agent relationship and the upstream call chain.

```json
// auth token booking+search1 presents at maps
{ "aud": "maps.example", "sub": "user:alice",
  "agent": "aauth:booking+search1@booking.example",
  "act": { "agent": "aauth:booking@booking.example",
           "act": { "agent": "aauth:asst@agent.example" } } }
```

# Third-Party Login {#third-party-login}

A third party — such as a PS, enterprise portal, app marketplace, or partner site — can direct a user to an agent's or resource's `login_endpoint` to initiate authentication. The agent or resource creates a resource token and sends it to the PS's token endpoint, obtaining an auth token with user identity.

This enables use cases where the user's journey starts outside the agent or resource — for example, an enterprise portal launching an agent for a specific user, an app marketplace connecting a user to a new service, or a PS dashboard directing a user to an agent.

## Login Endpoint

Agents and resources MAY publish a `login_endpoint` in their metadata. The `login_endpoint` accepts the following query parameters:

- `ps` (REQUIRED): The PS URL to authenticate with. The agent or resource MUST verify this is a valid PS by fetching its metadata at `{ps}/.well-known/aauth-person.json` (#ps-metadata).
- `login_hint` (OPTIONAL): Hint about who to authorize, per [@!OpenID.Core] Section 3.1.2.1.
- `domain_hint` (OPTIONAL): Domain hint, per OpenID Connect Enterprise Extensions 1.0 [@OpenID.Enterprise].
- `tenant` (OPTIONAL): Tenant identifier, per OpenID Connect Enterprise Extensions 1.0 [@OpenID.Enterprise].
- `start_path` (OPTIONAL): Path on the agent's or resource's origin where the user should be directed after login completes. The recipient MUST validate that `start_path` is a relative path on its own origin.

**Example login URL:**
```
https://agent.example/login
    ?ps=https://ps.example
    &tenant=corp
    &login_hint=user@corp.example
    &start_path=/projects/tokyo-trip
```

## Login Flow

Upon receiving a request at its `login_endpoint`, the agent or resource:

1. Validates the `ps` parameter by fetching the PS's metadata.
2. Creates a resource token with `aud` = PS URL, binding the request to its own identity.
3. POSTs to the PS's `token_endpoint` with the resource token and any provided `login_hint`, `domain_hint`, or `tenant` parameters.
4. Proceeds with the standard deferred response flow (#deferred-responses) — directing the user to the PS's interaction endpoint with the interaction code.
5. After obtaining the auth token, redirects the user to `start_path` if provided, or to a default landing page.

If the user is already authenticated at the PS, the interaction step resolves near-instantly — the PS recognizes the user from its own session. If not, the user completes a normal authentication and consent flow.

Figure: Third-Party Login Flow {#fig-third-party-login}

The third party does not need to be the PS. Any party that knows the agent's or resource's `login_endpoint` (from metadata) can initiate the flow. The agent or resource treats the redirect as untrusted input — it verifies the PS through metadata discovery and initiates a signed flow.

## Security Considerations for Third-Party Login

- The `login_endpoint` does not carry any tokens, codes, or pre-authorized state. The agent or resource initiates a standard signed flow with the PS, which independently authenticates the user.
- The `start_path` parameter MUST be validated as a relative path on the recipient's own origin to prevent open redirect attacks.
- The `ps` parameter is untrusted input. The agent or resource MUST discover and verify the PS via its well-known metadata before proceeding.

# Protocol Primitives {#protocol-primitives}

This section defines the common mechanisms used across all AAuth endpoints: requirement responses, capabilities, deferred responses, error responses, scopes, token revocation, HTTP message signatures, key discovery, identifiers, and metadata documents.

## AAuth-Capabilities Request Header {#aauth-capabilities}

Agents use the `AAuth-Capabilities` request header to declare which protocol capabilities they can handle. This allows resources and PSes to tailor their responses — for example, a resource that sees `interaction` in the capabilities knows it can send `requirement=interaction`, whereas a resource that does not see `interaction` knows it must use an alternative path (such as issuing a resource token for three-party mode).

The `AAuth-Capabilities` header field is a List ([@!RFC8941], Section 3.1) of Tokens.

```http
AAuth-Capabilities: interaction, clarification, payment
```

This specification defines the following capability values:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `interaction` | Agent can get a user to a URL — either directly (user is present) or via its PS's interaction endpoint |
| `clarification` | Agent can engage in back-and-forth clarification chat |
| `payment` | Agent can handle `402` payment flows — either directly or via its PS's interaction endpoint |

The agent determines its capabilities by combining what it can do directly with what its PS can do on its behalf. When the agent has a PS and has created a mission, the mission approval response MAY include a `capabilities` array listing what the PS can handle for this user/session (#mission-approval). When present, the agent unions those capabilities with its own to produce the `AAuth-Capabilities` header value.

Agents SHOULD include the `AAuth-Capabilities` header on signed requests to resources. The header is not used on requests to PS endpoints: on the PS token endpoint the agent conveys capabilities via the `capabilities` request parameter (#ps-token-endpoint), and within a mission the PS also has the capabilities captured at mission approval (#mission-approval). Recipients MUST ignore unrecognized capability values. When the header is absent, recipients MUST NOT assume any capabilities — the agent may not support interaction, clarification, or payment flows.

Capability values are Tokens and currently carry no parameters. A future capability value MAY define parameters; recipients MUST ignore parameters they do not recognize on a capability item rather than rejecting the header.

## Scopes {#scopes}

Scopes define what an agent is authorized to do at a resource. AAuth uses two categories of scope values:

- **Resource scopes**: Resource-specific authorization grants (e.g., `data.read`, `data.write`, `data.delete`). Each resource defines its own scope values and publishes human-readable descriptions in its metadata (`scope_descriptions`). Resources that already define OAuth scopes SHOULD use the same scope values in AAuth.
- **Identity scopes**: Requests for user identity claims following [@!OpenID.Core] (e.g., `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `address`, `phone`). When identity scopes are present, the auth token includes the corresponding identity claims. Enterprise extensions include the `tenant` claim from [@OpenID.Enterprise] and the `groups` and `roles` claims from [@!RFC9068] (originally defined by SCIM [@RFC7643]).

A resource token MUST only include resource scopes that the resource has defined in its `scope_descriptions` metadata, and identity scopes that the PS has declared in its `scopes_supported` metadata. This ensures all parties can interpret and present the requested scopes.

Scopes appear in three places in the protocol:

1. **Resource token** (`scope`): The scope the resource is willing to grant, as determined by the resource based on the agent's request at the authorization endpoint.
2. **Auth token** (`scope`): The scope actually granted. The auth token's scope MUST NOT be broader than the resource token's scope.
3. **Authorization endpoint request** (`scope`): The scope the agent is requesting from the resource.

The PS evaluates requested scopes against mission context (if present) and user consent. The AS evaluates scopes against resource policy. Either party may narrow the granted scope.

## Requirement Responses {#requirement-responses}

Servers use the `AAuth-Requirement` response header to indicate protocol-level requirements to agents. The header MAY be sent with `401 Unauthorized` or `202 Accepted` responses. A `401` response indicates that authorization is required. A `202` response indicates that the request is pending and additional action is required — user interaction (`requirement=interaction`), third-party approval (`requirement=approval`), a clarification answer (`requirement=clarification`), or identity claims (`requirement=claims`).

`AAuth-Requirement` and `WWW-Authenticate` are independent header fields; a response MAY include both. A client that understands AAuth processes `AAuth-Requirement`; a legacy client processes `WWW-Authenticate`. Neither header's presence invalidates the other. AAuth never conveys its own requirements via `WWW-Authenticate`; a resource's existing `WWW-Authenticate` challenges (e.g., `Bearer`, `Payment`) therefore remain fully available alongside `AAuth-Requirement`.

The header MAY also be sent with `402 Payment Required` when a server requires both authorization and payment. The `AAuth-Requirement` conveys the authorization requirement; the payment requirement is conveyed by a separate mechanism such as x402 [@x402] or the Machine Payment Protocol (MPP) ([@I-D.ryan-httpauth-payment]).

### AAuth-Requirement Header Structure

The `AAuth-Requirement` header field is a Dictionary ([@!RFC8941], Section 3.2). It MUST contain the following member:

- `requirement`: A Token ([@!RFC8941], Section 3.3.4) indicating the requirement type.

Requirement-specific data are conveyed as parameters on the `requirement` member (for example, `resource-token`, `url`, `code`). Recipients MUST ignore unknown parameters.

Example:

```http
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=auth-token; resource-token="eyJ..."
```

### Requirement Values

The `requirement` value is an extension point. This document defines the following values:

| Value | Status Code | Meaning | Resource | PS | AS |
|-------|-------------|---------|:--------:|:--:|:--:|
| `agent-token` | `401` | AAuth agent token required for identity-only access | Y | | |
| `auth-token` | `401` | Auth token required for resource access | Y | | |
| `interaction` | `202` | User action required at an interaction endpoint | Y | Y | Y |
| `approval` | `202` | Approval pending, poll for result | Y | Y | Y |
| `clarification` | `202` | Question posed to the recipient | Y | Y | Y |
| `claims` | `202` | Identity claims required | | | Y |

The `agent-token` requirement is defined in (#requirement-agent-token); the `auth-token` requirement in (#requirement-auth-token); the `interaction` and `approval` requirements are defined in this section;  `clarification` in (#requirement-clarification); and `claims` in (#requirement-claims).

An agent that does not recognize the `requirement` value MUST NOT treat the response as satisfiable. It surfaces the unsupported requirement to the caller as an error. For a `202` response with an unrecognized `requirement`, the agent MAY continue polling the `Location` URL in case a later response carries a requirement value it does understand, rather than immediately abandoning the request.

### Interaction Required

When a server requires user action — such as authentication, consent, payment approval, or any decision requiring a human in the loop — it returns a `202 Accepted` response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
AAuth-Requirement:
    requirement=interaction;
    url="https://example.com/interact";
    code="A1B2-C3D4"
Location: /pending/f7a3b9c
Retry-After: 0
```

The `AAuth-Requirement` header MUST include the following parameters:

- `url` (String): The interaction URL where the user completes the required action. MUST use the `https` scheme and MUST NOT contain query or fragment components.
- `code` (String): An interaction code that links the agent's pending request to the user's session at the interaction URL. Generated and compared per (#interaction-code-format).

The response MUST also include:

- `Location`: A URL the agent polls (with GET) for a terminal response.
- `Retry-After`: Recommended polling interval in seconds.

#### Interaction Code Format {#interaction-code-format}

The `code` is a Structured Field String ([@!RFC8941], Section 3.3.3). The user reads it out of band — the agent displays it (or renders it in a QR code) and the user visually compares it against the code shown on the interaction page — so it MUST be both unguessable and unambiguous to a human. Servers and agents MUST follow these rules.

**Alphabet.** The code MUST be generated from Crockford base32 ([@?I-D.crockford-davis-base32-for-humans]) — the symbol set `0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ`, which omits the visually ambiguous letters `I`, `L`, `O`, and `U`. Every symbol is URL-safe, so the code requires no escaping when appended as `{url}?code={code}`. Servers MUST NOT emit codes containing characters outside this set (other than the optional grouping hyphen below).

**Entropy and length.** A code MUST carry at least 40 bits of entropy — at least 8 Crockford base32 symbols, drawn from a cryptographically secure random source. Servers MAY use longer codes for higher-value interactions.

**Hyphens.** A server MAY insert hyphen (`-`) characters into the displayed code purely for visual grouping (for example, `A1B2-C3D4`). The hyphen is presentational only: it carries no entropy and is not part of the code's value. Before comparison, both the server and any party validating the code MUST strip all hyphens.

**Case.** Comparison MUST be case-insensitive. A server MUST accept the code regardless of the case the user enters, and on input MUST fold the Crockford decode aliases (`I`/`L` → `1`, `O` → `0`) before comparison so that a user who transcribes an ambiguous glyph still matches.

**Correlation only.** The code is a correlation identifier — it ties the user's browser session to the pending interaction so the server can look up the correct request. It is NOT an authorization credential. The person's approve/deny decision MUST be recorded via an authenticated channel at the PS; how the PS authenticates the person is outside the scope of this specification. Because the agent relays the interaction URL and code to the user, the code is visible to the agent — the code alone MUST NOT authorize the decision.

**Single use.** A code MUST be single-use. Once the user arrives at the interaction URL with a valid code and the code is consumed, the server MUST reject any later presentation of the same code, returning `invalid_code` (#polling-error-codes).

**Rate-limiting.** Because the code guards access to the interaction page, the server MUST rate-limit code-validation attempts at the interaction URL. After a small number of failed attempts the server MUST treat the pending interaction as terminally failed and return `invalid_code` (#polling-error-codes) on subsequent attempts, bounding the brute-force window to far fewer guesses than the code's entropy would otherwise allow.

**Lifetime.** A code MUST expire no later than the pending interaction it is bound to (#deferred-responses). Once the pending request has expired, presenting the code MUST fail with `expired` (#polling-error-codes); the agent MAY initiate a fresh request to obtain a new code.

#### Relaying Through the Person Server {#interaction-relay}

When the agent has a PS, it SHOULD relay the interaction to the PS's `interaction_endpoint` (#interaction-endpoint) before directing the user itself. The PS may have a lower-friction channel to the user — an active web session, a registered mobile app — than the agent opening a browser or rendering a QR code.

To relay, the agent POSTs `{ "type": "interaction", "url": "...", "code": "..." }` to the PS's `interaction_endpoint` (#interaction-endpoint). The PS attempts to reach the user through its own channels and responds:

- **PS can relay**: it returns a `202` deferred response, and the agent polls for completion as described in (#interaction-endpoint).
- **PS cannot relay**: it returns `interaction_unavailable` (#interaction-endpoint-errors). This is non-terminal — the agent falls back to directing the user itself.

The agent directs the user itself — using the methods below — when it has no PS, or when the PS returns `interaction_unavailable`.

To direct the user, the agent constructs a user-facing URL by appending the code as a query parameter: `{url}?code={code}`. The agent then directs the user to this URL using one of:

- **Browser redirect**: The agent opens the URL in the user's browser.
- **Display code**: The agent displays the `url` and `code` for the user to enter manually. The agent MAY also render the constructed URL as a QR code for the user to scan with their phone.

After directing the user, the agent polls the `Location` URL with GET requests, respecting the `Retry-After` interval. A `202` response means the request is still pending. A non-`202` response is terminal — `200` indicates success, `403` indicates denial, and `408` indicates timeout.

  |<---------------------------------------------------------|
~~~

**Use cases:** User login, consent, payment confirmation, document review, CAPTCHA, any workflow requiring human action.

### Approval Pending

When a server is obtaining approval from another party without requiring the agent to direct a user — for example, via push notification, email, or administrator review:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
AAuth-Requirement: requirement=approval
Location: /pending/f7a3b9c
Retry-After: 30
```

The response MUST include `Location` and `Retry-After`. The agent polls the `Location` URL with GET requests until a terminal response is received. No user action is required at the agent side. The same terminal response codes apply as for `interaction`.

**Use cases:** Administrator approval, resource owner consent, compliance review, direct user authorization via established communication channel.

## Deferred Responses {#deferred-responses}

Any endpoint in AAuth — whether a PS token endpoint, AS token endpoint, or resource endpoint — MAY return a `202 Accepted` response ([@!RFC9110]) when it cannot immediately resolve a request. This is a first-class protocol primitive, not a special case. Agents MUST handle `202` responses regardless of the nature of the original request.

### Initial Request

The agent makes a request and signals its willingness to wait using the `Prefer` header ([@!RFC7240]):

```http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.example
Content-Type: application/json
Prefer: wait=45
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "resource_token": "eyJhbGc..."
}
```

### Pending Response

When the server cannot resolve the request within the wait period:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /pending/f7a3b9c
Retry-After: 0
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "pending"
}
```

Headers:

- `Location` (REQUIRED): The pending URL. The `Location` URL MUST be on the same origin as the responding server.
- `Retry-After` (REQUIRED): Seconds the agent SHOULD wait before polling. `0` means retry immediately.
- `Cache-Control: no-store` (REQUIRED): Prevents caching of pending responses.
- `AAuth-Requirement` (OPTIONAL): Present when user interaction or approval is required. The `url` and `code` parameters are defined in (#requirement-responses).

Body fields:

- `status` (REQUIRED): `"pending"` while the request is waiting. `"interacting"` when the user has arrived at the interaction endpoint. Agents MUST treat unrecognized `status` values as `"pending"` and continue polling.

Additional body fields may be present depending on the `AAuth-Requirement` value — for example, `clarification` and `timeout` with `requirement=clarification`, or `required_claims` with `requirement=claims`. See the specific requirement definitions for details.

### Polling with GET

After receiving a `202`, the agent switches to `GET` for all subsequent requests to the `Location` URL. The agent does NOT resend the original request body. **Exception**: During clarification chat, the agent uses `POST` to deliver a clarification response.

The agent MUST respect `Retry-After` values. If a `Retry-After` header is not present, the default polling interval is 5 seconds. If the server responds with `429 Too Many Requests`, the agent MUST increase its polling interval by 5 seconds (linear backoff, following the pattern in [@RFC8628], Section 3.5). The `Prefer: wait=N` header ([@!RFC7240]) MAY be included on polling requests to signal the agent's willingness to wait for a long-poll response.

### Deferred Response State Machine

The following state machine applies to any AAuth endpoint that returns a `202 Accepted` response — including PS token endpoints, AS token endpoints, and resource endpoints during call chaining. A non-`202` response terminates polling.

```
Initial request (with Prefer: wait=N)
    |
    +-- 200 --> done — process response body
    +-- 202 --> note Location URL, check requirement/code
    +-- 400 --> invalid request — check error field, fix and retry
    +-- 401 --> invalid signature — check credentials;
    |           obtain auth token if resource challenge
    +-- 402 --> payment required (settle payment, poll Location)
    +-- 500 --> server error — start over
    +-- 503 --> back off per Retry-After, retry
               |
               GET Location (with Prefer: wait=N)
               |
               +-- 200 --> done — process response body
               +-- 202 --> continue polling (check status/clarification)
               |           status=interacting → stop prompting user
               +-- 403 --> denied or abandoned — surface to user
               +-- 408 --> expired — MAY initiate a fresh request
               +-- 410 --> gone — MUST NOT retry
               +-- 429 --> slow down — increase interval by 5s
               +-- 500 --> server error — start over
               +-- 503 --> temporarily unavailable
                           back off per Retry-After
```

## Error Responses {#error-responses}

### Authentication Errors

A `401` response from any AAuth endpoint uses the `Signature-Error` header as defined in ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]).

### Token Endpoint Error Response Format {#error-response-format}

Token endpoint errors use `Content-Type: application/json` ([@!RFC8259]) with the following members:

- `error` (REQUIRED): String. A single error code.
- `error_description` (OPTIONAL): String. A human-readable description.

### Token Endpoint Error Codes {#token-endpoint-error-codes}

| Error | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `invalid_request` | 400 | Malformed JSON, missing required fields |
| `invalid_agent_token` | 400 | Agent token malformed or signature verification failed |
| `expired_agent_token` | 400 | Agent token has expired |
| `invalid_resource_token` | 400 | Resource token malformed or signature verification failed |
| `expired_resource_token` | 400 | Resource token has expired |
| `user_unreachable` | 403 | Terminal. The PS has no channel to reach the user and the agent did not declare the `interaction` capability, so the user cannot be reached at all. The non-terminal "user action is needed" case uses a `202` with `requirement=interaction` (#requirement-responses), not this error. |
| `server_error` | 500 | Internal error |

### Polling Error Codes

| Error | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `denied` | 403 | User or approver explicitly denied the request |
| `abandoned` | 403 | Interaction code was used but user did not complete |
| `expired` | 408 | Timed out |
| `invalid_code` | 410 | Interaction code not recognized or already consumed |
| `slow_down` | 429 | Polling too frequently — increase interval by 5 seconds |
| `server_error` | 500 | Internal error |

## Token Revocation {#token-revocation}

Any AAuth server that issues tokens MAY provide a revocation endpoint. The endpoint accepts a signed POST with the `jti` of the token to revoke. The server identifies the token from the `jti` and its own records — no token type is needed since the `jti` is unique within the issuer's namespace.

**Request:**

```http
POST /revoke HTTP/1.1
Host: ps.example
Content-Type: application/json
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority"
    "@path" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:...signature bytes...:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGc..."

{
  "jti": "unique-token-identifier"
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK` if the token was revoked or was already invalid. `404` if the `jti` is not recognized.

Revocation provides real-time termination of access. The PS or AS calls the revocation endpoint of the resource that a token was issued for, passing the `jti` of the auth token to revoke. The following revocation scenarios are supported:

- **PS revokes an auth token it issued** (three-party): The PS calls the resource's revocation endpoint with the auth token's `jti`.
- **PS revokes an auth token it provided** (four-party): The PS calls the resource's revocation endpoint with the auth token's `jti`. The PS MAY also notify the AS.
- **AS revokes an auth token it issued**: The AS calls the resource's revocation endpoint with the auth token's `jti`.
- **PS revokes a mission**: The PS marks the mission as revoked. All subsequent token requests referencing that mission's `s256` are denied. The PS SHOULD revoke outstanding auth tokens issued under the mission.
- **Agent provider stops issuing agent tokens**: The agent provider decides not to issue new agent tokens to the agent. Existing agent tokens expire naturally. This is part of the regular token lifecycle — all tokens have limited lifetimes and require periodic re-issuance, which provides a natural policy re-evaluation point.

Revocation endpoints are advertised in server metadata as `revocation_endpoint`. Resources that accept revocation requests MUST verify the caller's identity via HTTP Message Signatures and MUST only accept revocation from the issuer of the token being revoked or from a trusted PS.

Auth tokens are short-lived (maximum 1 hour) and proof-of-possession (useless without the bound signing key). All AAuth tokens have limited lifetimes — agent tokens, resource tokens, and auth tokens all expire and require re-issuance. Each re-issuance is a policy evaluation point where the issuer can deny renewal. This natural expiration cycle, combined with real-time revocation, provides layered access control.

## HTTP Message Signatures Profile {#http-message-signatures-profile}

This section profiles HTTP Message Signatures ([@!RFC9421]) for use with AAuth. Signing requirements (what the agent does) and verification requirements (what the server does) are specified separately.

### Signature Algorithms

Agents and resources MUST support EdDSA using Ed25519 ([@!RFC8032]). Agents and resources SHOULD support ECDSA using P-256 with deterministic signatures ([@!RFC6979]). The `alg` parameter in the JWK ([@!RFC7517]) key representation identifies the algorithm. See the IANA JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms registry ([@RFC7518], Section 7.1) for the full list of algorithm identifiers.

### Keying Material {#keying-material}

The signing key is conveyed in the `Signature-Key` header ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). Because every AAuth agent holds an agent token (#agent-tokens), AAuth uses the **identity** `scheme=jwt`: the agent presents its agent token — or, after authorization, an auth token — and the public key is taken from the token's `cnf` claim. Agents MUST use `scheme=jwt`; agents MUST NOT use `scheme=jwks_uri` or `scheme=hwk` for AAuth resource, PS, or AS requests.

The Signature-Key specification also defines `pseudonym` schemes (`scheme=hwk` for a bare inline public key, `scheme=jkt-jwt` for hardware-key delegation). AAuth does not use bare `hwk` access — the agent token is the minimum AAuth credential. `scheme=jkt-jwt` is used only in the agent provider's key-refresh ceremony (see [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap]), not for protocol access to resources, PSes, or ASes.

See the Signature-Key specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]) for scheme definitions, key discovery, and verification procedures.

### Signing (Agent)

The agent creates an HTTP Message Signature ([@!RFC9421]) on each request, including the following headers:

- `Signature-Key`: Public key or key reference for signature verification
- `Signature-Input`: Signature metadata including covered components
- `Signature`: The HTTP message signature

#### Covered Components {#covered-components}

The signature MUST cover the following derived components and header fields:

- `@method`: The HTTP request method ([@!RFC9421], Section 2.2.1)
- `@authority`: The target host ([@!RFC9421], Section 2.2.3)
- `@path`: The request path ([@!RFC9421], Section 2.2.6)
- `signature-key`: The Signature-Key header value

These four are mandated rather than advisory because each closes a request-substitution attack and all four are derivable by the agent at signing time on every platform, including browsers: `@method` prevents a captured signature from being replayed with a different method (a signed `GET` reused as a `DELETE`); `@authority` binds the signature to the target host, preventing cross-host replay; `@path` binds it to the specific endpoint; and `signature-key` binds the signature to the presented key material, preventing key substitution. Omitting any one would let a captured signature be replayed against a different method, host, path, or key.

Servers MAY require additional covered components (e.g., `content-digest` ([@RFC9530]) for request body integrity). The agent learns about additional requirements from server metadata or from an `invalid_input` error response that includes `required_input`.

The following example shows a fully bound request combining an opaque `AAuth-Access` token, an `AAuth-Mission` reference, and an HTTP Message Signature. Token and key values are illustrative placeholders, not parseable test vectors. `Authorization: AAuth` carries the opaque resource access token; `Signature-Key` carries the auth token (four-party) or agent token, whose `cnf.jwk` is the signing key. A valid signature over these components proves request-component integrity; authorization still depends on auth-token claims and resource enforcement.

```http
GET /api/documents HTTP/1.1
Host: resource.example
Authorization: AAuth opaque-access-token-placeholder
AAuth-Mission: approver="https://ps.example";
    s256="dBjftJeZ4CVP-mB92K27uhbUJU1p1r_wW1gFWFOEjXk"
Signature-Input: sig=("@method" "@authority" "@path"
    "authorization" "aauth-mission" "signature-key");created=1730217600
Signature: sig=:BASE64URL-SIGNATURE-PLACEHOLDER:
Signature-Key: sig=jwt;jwt="eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9.PLACEHOLDER.PLACEHOLDER"
```

#### Signature Parameters

The `Signature-Input` header ([@!RFC9421], Section 4.1) MUST include the following parameters:

- `created`: Signature creation timestamp as an Integer (Unix time). The agent MUST set this to the current time.

### Verification (Server) {#verification}

When a server receives a signed request, it MUST perform the following steps. Any failure MUST result in a `401` response with the appropriate `Signature-Error` header ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]).

1. Extract the `Signature`, `Signature-Input`, and `Signature-Key` headers. If any are missing, return `invalid_request`.
2. Verify that the `Signature-Input` covers the required components defined in (#covered-components). If the server requires additional components, verify those are covered as well. If not, return `invalid_input` with `required_input`.
3. Verify the `created` parameter is present and within the server's signature validity window of the server's current time. The default window is 60 seconds. Servers MAY advertise a different window via their metadata (e.g., `signature_window` in resource metadata). Reject with `invalid_signature` if outside this window. Servers and agents SHOULD synchronize their clocks using NTP ([@RFC5905]).
4. Determine the signature algorithm from the `alg` parameter in the key. If the algorithm is not supported, return `unsupported_algorithm`.
5. Obtain the public key from the `Signature-Key` header according to the scheme, as specified in ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). Return `invalid_key` if the key cannot be parsed, `unknown_key` if the key is not found at the `jwks_uri`, `invalid_jwt` if a JWT scheme fails verification, or `expired_jwt` if the JWT has expired.
6. Verify the HTTP Message Signature ([@!RFC9421]) using the obtained public key and determined algorithm. Return `invalid_signature` if verification fails.

#### Freshness and Replay {#freshness-and-replay}

The `created` parameter is the primary replay defense: the server rejects signatures whose `created` is outside the validity window (default 60 seconds), so a captured signature becomes unusable once the window closes. `expires` is OPTIONAL; servers MUST honor it when present and MUST reject requests where `expires` is in the past.

Within the validity window, a captured signature could in principle be replayed. For state-changing requests where this matters, a verifier MAY maintain a short-lived cache keyed by `(signing-key-thumbprint, created, @method, @authority, @path)` for the duration of the window, rejecting duplicate tuples. `@authority` is included because it is a mandated covered component (#covered-components) and distinguishes requests across virtual hosts or tenants sharing the same path. Resources are NOT required to maintain replay caches for resource tokens (#resource-tokens), which are consumed in a single PS call. This profile defines no nonce mechanism.

## JWKS Discovery and Caching {#jwks-discovery}

All AAuth token verification — agent tokens, resource tokens, and auth tokens — requires discovering the issuer's signing keys via the `{iss}/.well-known/{dwk}` pattern defined in the HTTP Signature Keys specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]).

Implementations MUST cache JWKS responses and SHOULD respect HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `Expires`) returned by the JWKS endpoint. When an implementation encounters an unknown `kid` in a JWT header, it SHOULD refresh the cached JWKS for that issuer to support key rotation. To prevent abuse, implementations MUST NOT fetch a given issuer's JWKS more frequently than once per minute. If a JWKS fetch fails, implementations SHOULD use the cached JWKS if available and SHOULD retry with exponential backoff. Cached JWKS entries SHOULD be discarded after a maximum of 24 hours regardless of cache headers, to ensure removed keys are no longer trusted.

If a cached key matching the JWT `kid` fails signature verification, the verifier SHOULD refresh the issuer's JWKS once and retry before returning `unknown_key` (if the key is then absent from the refreshed JWKS) or `invalid_jwt` (if verification still fails), subject to the once-per-minute floor above. This covers silent re-keying where the issuer replaces key material under the same `kid` without changing the identifier.

Before fetching any issuer metadata or `jwks_uri`, verifiers MUST apply egress admission per ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]).

## Identifiers {#identifiers-and-discovery}

### Server Identifiers

The `issuer` values in metadata documents that identify agent providers, resources, access servers, and person servers MUST conform to the following:

- MUST use the `https` scheme
- MUST contain only scheme and host (no port, path, query, or fragment)
- MUST NOT include a trailing slash
- MUST be lowercase
- Internationalized domain names MUST use the ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) form (A-labels) as defined in [@!RFC5890]

Valid identifiers:

- `https://agent.example`
- `https://xn--nxasmq6b.example` (internationalized domain in ACE form)

Invalid identifiers:

- `http://agent.example` (not HTTPS)
- `https://Agent.Example` (not lowercase)
- `https://agent.example:8443` (contains port)
- `https://agent.example/v1` (contains path)
- `https://agent.example/` (trailing slash)

Implementations MUST perform exact string comparison on server identifiers.

### Endpoint URLs

The `token_endpoint`, `authorization_endpoint`, `mission_endpoint`, and `callback_endpoint` values MUST conform to the following:

- MUST use the `https` scheme
- MUST NOT contain a fragment
- MUST NOT contain a query string

When `localhost_callback_allowed` is `true` in the agent's metadata, the agent MAY use a localhost callback URL as the `callback` parameter to the interaction endpoint.

### Other URLs

The `jwks_uri`, `tos_uri`, `policy_uri`, `logo_uri`, and `logo_dark_uri` values MUST use the `https` scheme.

## Metadata Documents {#metadata-documents}

Participants publish metadata at well-known URLs ([@!RFC8615]) to enable discovery.

When fetching a metadata document, implementations MUST verify that the `issuer` value in the document matches the URL the document was retrieved from (the URL minus the `/.well-known/{dwk}` suffix). If the values do not match, the metadata document MUST be rejected.

This check prevents host-poisoned metadata: an attacker hosting a metadata document at one domain that claims an `issuer` of a different domain. Without it, a permissive verifier following the `jwks_uri` in such a document could end up trusting attacker-controlled keys for tokens claiming the impersonated issuer.

The following fields are defined identically across all four metadata documents (`aauth-agent.json`, `aauth-resource.json`, `aauth-person.json`, `aauth-access.json`):

| Field | Requirement | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `issuer` | REQUIRED | The server's HTTPS URL. MUST match the URL the document was fetched from. Placed in the `iss` claim of JWTs issued by this server. Required by any Signature-Key verifier to confirm the document belongs to the claimed signer ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). |
| `jwks_uri` | REQUIRED (see per-role) | URL to the server's JSON Web Key Set. |
| `name` | OPTIONAL | Human-readable display name. |
| `description` | OPTIONAL | Markdown string describing the server, for display at consent screens or dashboards. Implementations MUST sanitize before rendering. |
| `logo_uri` | OPTIONAL | URL to the server's logo. MUST use `https`. |
| `logo_dark_uri` | OPTIONAL | URL to the server's logo for dark backgrounds. MUST use `https`. |
| `documentation_uri` | OPTIONAL | URL with developer documentation. MUST use `https`. |
| `tos_uri` | OPTIONAL | URL to terms of service. MUST use `https`. |
| `policy_uri` | OPTIONAL | URL to privacy policy. MUST use `https`. |

AAuth intentionally diverges from RFC 9728 on two points: AAuth uses `issuer` (not `resource`) as the primary identifier field so that a generic Signature-Key verifier can extract the signer identity uniformly from any dwk document without knowing which role it represents; and AAuth uses unprefixed field names (`name`, `tos_uri`, `policy_uri`, `documentation_uri`) rather than the `resource_`-prefixed forms in RFC 9728, for consistency across all four roles.

Per-role sections below list these common fields in their examples and note any role-specific REQUIRED/conditional differences (e.g., `jwks_uri` is conditionally REQUIRED for resources). Role-specific fields are listed after the common fields.

  "issuer": "https://resource.example",

  },
  "additional_signature_components": ["content-type", "content-digest"]
}
```

Fields:

- `issuer` (REQUIRED): The resource's HTTPS URL. This is the value placed in the `iss` claim of resource tokens.
- `jwks_uri` (REQUIRED when the resource issues resource tokens or makes signed calls): URL to the resource's JSON Web Key Set. A resource that only verifies agent signatures for identity-based access — issuing no resource tokens and making no signed requests of its own (e.g., as an agent in multi-hop, #multi-hop) — has no keys to publish and MAY omit `jwks_uri`.
- `access_mode` (OPTIONAL): The credential flow the resource expects, letting an agent plan its first call without a speculative challenge. One of `agent-token` (identity-only — the agent signs with its agent token), `aauth-access-token` (resource-managed — the agent completes the resource's interaction/consent flow and receives an opaque token via `AAuth-Access`), or `auth-token` (the agent obtains an auth token from its PS using a resource token). Default: `agent-token`. The declaration is advisory: a resource MAY return any `AAuth-Requirement` at runtime regardless of the declared mode (#requirement-responses), and MAY apply different modes to different endpoints. An agent MAY use `access_mode` to skip resources its setup cannot satisfy — for example, a PS-less agent (no `ps` claim in its agent token) cannot complete the `auth-token` flow.
- `name` (OPTIONAL): Human-readable resource name
- `description` (OPTIONAL): A Markdown string describing the resource, for display to users (for example, at a consent screen). Implementations MUST sanitize the Markdown before rendering to users.
- `logo_uri` (OPTIONAL): URL to resource logo
- `logo_dark_uri` (OPTIONAL): URL to resource logo for dark backgrounds
- `documentation_uri` (OPTIONAL): URL with developer documentation for the resource
- `tos_uri` (OPTIONAL): URL to terms of service
- `policy_uri` (OPTIONAL): URL to privacy policy
- `authorization_endpoint` (OPTIONAL): URL where agents request authorization (#authorization-endpoint-request). When absent, the resource issues resource tokens and interaction requirements via `401` responses (#requirement-auth-token, #resource-managed-auth).
- `login_endpoint` (OPTIONAL): URL where third parties can direct users to initiate authentication (#third-party-login)
- `scope_descriptions` (OPTIONAL): Object mapping scope values to Markdown strings for consent display. Scope values are resource-specific; resources that already define OAuth scopes SHOULD use the same scope values in AAuth. Identity-related scopes (e.g., `openid`, `profile`, `email`) follow [@!OpenID.Core].
- `signature_window` (OPTIONAL): Integer. The signature validity window in seconds for the `created` timestamp. Default: 60. Resources serving agents with poor clock synchronization (mobile, IoT) MAY advertise a larger value. High-security resources MAY advertise a smaller value.
- `additional_signature_components` (OPTIONAL): Array of HTTP message component identifiers ([@!RFC9421]) that agents MUST include in the `Signature-Input` covered components when signing requests to this resource, in addition to the base components required by the HTTP Message Signatures profile ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key])
- `revocation_endpoint` (OPTIONAL): URL where authorized parties can revoke auth tokens for this resource (#token-revocation)

# Incremental Adoption {#incremental-adoption}

AAuth is designed for incremental adoption. Each party — agent, resource, PS, AS — can independently add support. The system works at every partial adoption state. No coordination is required between parties.

## Drop-In Replacement for API Keys and OAuth {#drop-in-migration}

The first two resource steps require neither a person server nor an access server. They map directly onto what resources already do today:

- **Identity-based access drops in where you use API keys.** A resource that verifies the agent's HTTP Message Signature gets a cryptographic, per-agent identity in place of a shared secret — nothing to copy and leak, no pre-registration, no authorization flow. The agent signs, the resource recognizes who it is and applies its existing access control. This is identity-based access (#overview-identity-access); it involves no PS and no AS.
- **Resource-managed access drops in where you use OAuth.** A resource keeps its existing authorization — consent screens, OAuth access tokens, or session tokens — and wraps it: it returns its existing token opaquely via the `AAuth-Access` header (#aauth-access), bound to the agent's signature so it cannot be stolen and replayed as a standalone bearer token. The resource talks directly to the agent. This is resource-managed (two-party) access (#overview-resource-managed); it too involves no PS and no AS.

Both modes are complete and useful on their own. Adding a PS (PS-asserted, three-party) and an AS (federated, four-party) is additive — it brings cross-domain identity assertion and policy federation — but neither is a prerequisite for the value a resource gets from the first two steps.

### Consuming a Resource End to End {#consuming-a-resource}

A resource that wants agents to discover and use it with no prior integration publishes two things in its `aauth-resource.json` (#resource-metadata):

- **`access_mode`** — the credential flow the agent should expect: `agent-token`, `aauth-access-token`, or `auth-token`.
- **An R3 vocabulary.** Resources SHOULD advertise an R3 vocabulary (`r3_vocabularies`, [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-r3]) describing their operations, so that an agent that knows only the resource's hostname can learn the API and begin using it. The R3 document itself is fetched only by the AS and PS, not the agent; the vocabulary (an OpenAPI, MCP, gRPC, or similar API description) is the agent-facing surface.

An agent onboards as follows:

1. Fetch `aauth-resource.json`; read `access_mode` and the advertised vocabulary.
2. Fetch the vocabulary to learn the resource's operations, then construct calls.
3. If `access_mode` is `auth-token` and the agent has no PS, it cannot complete that flow and SHOULD skip the resource.
4. Make the call and satisfy whatever the resource requires, bringing the user in only where the mode calls for it:
   - **`agent-token`** — the agent signs with its agent token and calls. If the resource needs to bind the agent to a user account (the equivalent of associating an API key with an account), it returns a `202` with `requirement=interaction` (#requirement-responses) pointing at a login or account-link page; the agent brings the user there, directly or via the PS's interaction endpoint (#interaction-endpoint). Once bound, subsequent calls with the same agent token are recognized with no further interaction. No token is issued — the account-bound agent token is the durable credential.
   - **`aauth-access-token`** — the agent's call, or a request to the `authorization_endpoint`, triggers a `202` with `requirement=interaction` pointing at the resource's existing consent or login flow. After the user completes it, the resource returns an opaque token via the `AAuth-Access` header (#aauth-access); the agent presents that token in `Authorization: AAuth ...`, bound to its signature, on subsequent calls.
   - **`auth-token`** — the resource issues a resource token via the `authorization_endpoint` or a `401` (#requirement-auth-token). The agent sends it to its PS, which runs consent — bringing the user in at the PS, not the resource — and returns an auth token the agent signs with. Whether the PS asserts identity directly (three-party) or federates with the resource's AS (four-party) is invisible to the agent.

Throughout, the agent runs a single loop: make the request, read any `AAuth-Requirement`, satisfy it — bringing in the user where the requirement directs — and retry. The `access_mode` declaration lets the agent anticipate the flow; the runtime `AAuth-Requirement` remains authoritative, so a resource can mix modes across endpoints or escalate at any time.

## Agent Adoption Path

Each step builds on the previous one. An agent that adopts any step gains immediate value.

1. **Obtain an agent token and sign requests** (`scheme=jwt`, `typ: aa-agent+jwt`): The agent has a full AAuth identity with an `aauth:local@domain` identifier issued by an agent provider. It signs requests using HTTP Message Signatures ([@!RFC9421]) per the Signature-Key specification ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]) and presents its agent token via the `Signature-Key` header using `scheme=jwt`. Resources that recognize signatures can verify the agent's identity and apply access control. Resources that don't ignore the signature and `Signature-Key` headers — existing auth mechanisms continue to work. This enables identity-based access.
2. **Add a person server** (include `ps` claim in agent token): The agent can obtain auth tokens from its PS directly. Resources in three-party and four-party modes can issue resource tokens targeting the PS. Enables PS-issued auth tokens with user identity, `tenant`, `groups`, and `roles` claims.
3. **Add governance** (create a mission): The agent creates a mission at its PS, gaining permissions, audit, PS-relayed interactions, and consent-managed resource access. The mission can be as simple as the user's prompt.

## Resource Adoption Path

Each step builds on the previous one. A resource that adopts any step works with agents at all identity levels.

1. **Recognize AAuth signatures**: Verify HTTP Message Signatures and respond with `Accept-Signature` headers ([@!I-D.hardt-httpbis-signature-key]). Resources that don't recognize AAuth ignore the signature headers — existing auth mechanisms continue to work. This is identity-based access.
2. **Manage authorization**: Handle authorization with interaction, consent, or existing infrastructure — via `401` responses, an authorization endpoint, or both. Return `AAuth-Access` headers (#aauth-access) for subsequent calls. This is resource-managed access (two-party).
3. **Accept identity claims from any PS**: Read the `ps` claim from the agent token and issue resource tokens with `aud` = PS URL. The agent's PS returns an auth token asserting identity claims about the user and consent for the requested scope; the resource applies its own policy. This is PS-asserted access (three-party).
4. **Deploy an access server**: Issue resource tokens with `aud` = AS URL. The PS federates with the AS. This is federated access (four-party).

## Adoption Matrix

| Agent | Resource | Mode | What Works |
|-------|----------|------|------------|
| Agent token | Recognizes signatures | Identity-based | Identity verification, access control by agent identity |
| Agent token | Manages authorization | Resource-managed | Resource-handled auth, interaction, `AAuth-Access` |
| Agent token + `ps` | Issues resource tokens | PS-asserted | PS asserts user identity, `tenant`, `groups`, `roles`; resource applies its own policy |
| Agent token + `ps` | AS deployed | Federated | Full federation, AS policy enforcement |
| Agent token + `ps` + mission | Any or none | + governance | Tool-call permissions, audit, PS-relayed interaction, consent-managed access |

# Security Considerations

## Proof-of-Possession

All AAuth tokens are proof-of-possession tokens. The holder must prove possession of the private key corresponding to the public key in the token's `cnf` claim.

## Token Security

- Agent tokens bind agent keys to agent identity
- Resource tokens bind access requests to resource identity, preventing confused deputy attacks
- Auth tokens bind authorization grants to agent keys

## Pending URL Security

- Pending URLs MUST be unguessable and SHOULD have limited lifetime
- Pending URLs MUST be on the same origin as the server that issued them
- Servers MUST verify the agent's identity on every poll
- Once a terminal response is returned, the pending URL MUST return `410 Gone`

## Clarification Chat Security

- PSes MUST enforce a maximum number of clarification rounds
- Clarification responses from agents are untrusted input and MUST be sanitized before display

## Untrusted Input

All protocol inputs — JSON request bodies, clarification responses, justification strings, mission descriptions, and token claims — are untrusted input from potentially adversarial parties. This is consistent with standard web security practice where HTTP request bodies, headers, and query parameters are always treated as untrusted. Implementations MUST sanitize all values before rendering to users and MUST validate all values before processing. Markdown fields MUST be sanitized before rendering to prevent script injection.

## Interaction Code Misdirection

An attacker could attempt to trick a user into approving an authorization request by directing them to an interaction URL with the attacker's code. The PS mitigates this by displaying the full request context — the agent's identity, the resource being accessed, and the requested scope — so the user can recognize requests they did not initiate. A stronger mitigation is for the PS to interact directly with the user via a pre-established channel (push notification, email, or existing session) using `requirement=approval`, which eliminates the possibility of misdirection through attacker-supplied links entirely.

The reverse threat — an attacker who knows a pending request's interaction URL but not its `code` and tries to guess it to drive the interaction — is bounded by the code-format rules in (#interaction-code-format). The minimum 40 bits of entropy make a single guess overwhelmingly likely to fail, and the mandatory rate-limit terminates the pending interaction after a few failed attempts, capping total guesses far below the entropy bound. These entropy and rate-limit requirements are the brute-force defense; they complement the user-recognition and pre-established-channel defenses above, which address misdirection of a legitimate code rather than recovery of an unknown one.

## Token Issuer Discovery

The recipient of the resource token — and thus the issuer of the auth token — is identified by the `aud` claim. In three-party mode, `aud` identifies the agent's PS, which asserts identity and consent. In four-party mode, `aud` identifies the resource's AS, which evaluates resource policy. Federation mechanics for four-party are described in (#ps-as-federation).

## AAuth-Access Security

The `AAuth-Access` header carries an opaque wrapped token that is meaningful only to the issuing resource. The token MUST NOT be usable as a standalone bearer token — the resource wraps its internal authorization state so that the token is meaningless without a valid AAuth signature from the agent. The agent MUST include `authorization` in the signed components when presenting the token, binding it to the signed request.

## Trust Posture in PS-Asserted Access

In three-party mode, the resource has no AS of its own — it accepts identity claims and consent from whichever PS the agent declares. This is a deliberate trust posture: the resource externalizes identity claim issuance while retaining policy enforcement. Resources MUST apply their own policy on the resulting claims rather than treating the PS-issued auth token as a bearer authorization. Resources that need policy decisions made externally (per-resource scope enforcement, organizational gating, billing) should deploy an AS and use four-party mode.

Because identity assertion does not require pre-registration, the resource follows the same protocol flow whether it is meeting the user for the first time or recognizing a returning one. The auth token's `(iss, sub)` pair is a stable identifier per user per PS — the resource looks up the tuple and creates a new user record on a miss, matches an existing one on a hit. As in many OIDC deployments, registration and login are the same flow; the resource's own logic distinguishes the two outcomes. In multi-tenant deployments the auth token MAY also carry a `tenant` claim ([@OpenID.Enterprise]); `(iss, tenant, sub)` identifies a user within an organization, and `(iss, tenant)` identifies the organization itself — useful for grouping users from the same employer or account.

The PS MUST protect its signing keys with appropriate rigor — compromise of a PS's signing key allows forgery of identity claims for every resource that accepts that PS.

## PS Approval Endpoint Authentication {#ps-approval-endpoint-auth}

When the PS approval/consent endpoint is reachable beyond a single-user local deployment, the PS MUST authenticate the approving party before acting on a consent or denial decision. Acceptable mechanisms include an operator session cookie, a signed request from an authenticated operator, or an equivalent out-of-band channel.

An unauthenticated approval endpoint allows a remote party to consent on the user's behalf — a privilege escalation that breaks the agent-person binding invariant (#agent-person-binding). A locally-trusted PS (loopback only, no external network reachability) is exempt from this requirement provided it enforces OS-level access controls on the loopback interface.

## Agent-Person Binding {#agent-person-binding}

The PS MUST ensure that each agent is associated with exactly one person. This one-to-one binding is a trust invariant — it ensures that every action an agent takes is attributable to a single accountable party.

The binding is typically established lazily — when the person first authorizes the agent at the PS via the interaction flow. The PS recognizes a returning agent by `(agent_token.iss, agent_token.sub)`; on first interaction with a new tuple for a person, the PS SHOULD treat it as a new-agent enrollment and surface this clearly at the consent screen, displaying the agent provider's name and logo (from agent provider metadata) alongside any agent-supplied display values (`platform`, `device`) provided in the request. An organization administrator may pre-authorize agents for the organization. Once established, the PS MUST NOT allow a different person to claim the same agent. If an agent's association needs to change (e.g., an employee leaves an organization), the existing binding MUST be revoked and a new binding established.

This invariant enables:

- **Accountability**: Every authorization decision traces to a single person.
- **Consent integrity**: Consent granted by one person cannot be exercised by a different person through the same agent.
- **Audit**: The PS can provide a complete record of an agent's actions on behalf of its person.
- **Revocation**: Revoking an agent's association with its person immediately prevents the agent from obtaining new auth tokens.

## PS as High-Value Target

The PS is a centralized authority that sees every authorization in a mission. PS implementations MUST apply appropriate security controls including access control, audit logging, and monitoring. Compromise of a PS could affect all agents and missions it manages.

Several architectural properties mitigate this centralization risk. The person chooses their PS — no other party in the protocol imposes a PS, and the person can migrate to a different PS at any time. The PS MAY delegate authentication to an identity provider chosen by the person or organization (e.g., an enterprise IdP via OIDC federation), reducing the PS's role in credential management. The PS MAY also delegate policy evaluation to external services selected by the person, so that consent and authorization decisions are not solely determined by the PS operator. To the rest of the protocol, the PS presents a single interface regardless of how it is composed internally.

## Call Chaining Identity

When a resource acts as an agent in call chaining, it uses its own signing key and presents its own credentials. The resource MUST publish agent metadata so downstream parties can verify its identity.

## Token Revocation and Lifecycle

Real-time revocation (#token-revocation) and short token lifetimes provide layered access control. Organizations have multiple control points — agent provider, PS, and AS — each of which can deny renewal or revoke tokens independently. Shorter auth token lifetimes reduce the window between a control action and natural expiration.

## TLS Requirements

All HTTPS connections MUST use TLS 1.2 or later, following the recommendations in BCP 195 [@!RFC9325].

## Non-Repudiation and Audit After Key Rotation

AAuth signatures prove authenticity at request time: a valid HTTP Message Signature shows that the signer held the private key bound to the presented identity when the request was made (proof-of-possession). This is request-time authentication, not long-term non-repudiation. Agent keys are short-lived and agent providers rotate their JWKS; once a key is removed from the issuer's JWKS, a signature made with it can no longer be verified by re-fetching the JWKS later. The persistent identifiers (`agent`, `sub`) do not by themselves cryptographically prove that a specific key signed a specific request at a specific time once that key is gone.

This is partly by design — short-lived keys and directed identifiers (#directed-identifiers) limit long-term linkability. Deployments that require durable audit or non-repudiation beyond a key's lifetime SHOULD capture the evidence at verification time, while the key is still discoverable, rather than relying on re-verification later:

- **Archive the verified artifacts.** At verification time, record the signed request (covered components and signature), the `Signature-Key` value (the presented key or JWT), the verification result, and a trusted timestamp. Optionally snapshot the issuer's JWKS entry (`kid` + JWK) so the key binding can be re-checked independently of later rotation.
- **Use external timestamping or transparency logs** where stronger non-repudiation is needed — for example, RFC 3161 [@?RFC3161] timestamps over the signed request, or appending verification records to a tamper-evident log.
- **Bind audit records to durable identifiers.** Index archived records by `(iss, sub)` for agents and by `jti` for tokens, so later review can attribute activity even though the signing key is no longer live.

These measures trade privacy for durability: archived signatures and keys are correlatable, so deployments MUST balance audit retention against the privacy-preserving properties of short-lived keys and directed identifiers (#privacy-considerations), and apply appropriate retention limits and access controls.

# Privacy Considerations

## Directed Identifiers

The PS SHOULD provide a pairwise pseudonymous user identifier (`sub`) per resource, preventing resources from correlating users across trust domains. Each resource sees a different `sub` for the same user, preserving user privacy.

## PS Visibility

In three-party and four-party modes, the PS sees every authorization request made by its agents — including the resource being accessed, the requested scope, and the mission context. This centralized visibility enables governance and audit, but it also means the PS is a sensitive data aggregation point. The person chooses to trust their PS with this visibility — no other party imposes the choice. PS implementations MUST apply appropriate access controls and data retention policies.

In two-party mode, no PS is involved and there is no centralized visibility — the resource handles authorization directly with the agent.

## Mission Content Exposure

The mission JSON is visible to the PS and, when included in resource tokens and auth tokens via the `s256` hash, its integrity is verifiable by any party that holds it. The approved mission JSON is shared between the agent and PS. Resources and ASes see only the `s256` hash and the approver URL, not the full mission content.

## URI Scheme Registration

This specification registers the `aauth` URI scheme in the "Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" registry ([@!RFC7595]):

- Scheme name: `aauth`
- Status: Permanent

- Contact: IETF
- Change controller: IETF
- Reference: This document, (#agent-identifiers)

The `aauth` URI scheme follows the pattern established by the `acct` scheme ([@RFC7565]). An `aauth` URI identifies an agent instance and has the syntax `aauth:local@domain`, where `local` is the agent-specific part and `domain` is the agent provider's domain name. The `aauth` URI is used in the `sub` claim of agent tokens, the `agent` field of resource tokens and the mission blob, and the `agent` and `act.agent` fields of auth tokens.

# Document History

*Note: This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.*

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-08
  - Call chaining: upstream token `aud` MUST equal the `iss` of the intermediary's agent token; routing to PS or AS is derived from the upstream auth token (`mission.approver` or `iss`), not the calling agent's `ps` claim; PS MUST require a mission to remain in the loop for four-party upstream chains.
  - Interaction code: added that the code is a correlation identifier, not an authorization credential; the code alone MUST NOT authorize the decision.

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-07
  - Added `Interaction Callback Errors` section defining the `?error=` wire format for callback redirects (`access_denied`, `user_abandoned`, `server_error`, `temporarily_unavailable`, `interaction_expired`) and the PS mapping to polling errors. Updated Resource-Initiated Interaction to reference the new section and specify PS behavior on error callbacks. Added Joshua Gay to Acknowledgments.

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-06
  - Implementation and interoperability clarity driven by feedback from Joshua Gay (sidecat): mission reference dereference boundary and `approver`/`s256` syntax rules; agent keying material restricted to `scheme=jwt`; `AAuth-Requirement` parameter shape and unknown-value behavior; `AAuth-Access` token grammar (`token68`); `AAuth-Capabilities` forward-compatibility; JWKS same-`kid` refresh and egress admission; auth token verification split into JWT trust and request-context binding with structured `cnf.jwk` failure ordering; PS approval endpoint authentication security consideration; freshness and replay policy subsection. Interoperability demo profile extracted to a standalone non-normative document.

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-05
  - Auth tokens: `act` is OPTIONAL, absent in direct authorization; `act.agent` identifies the immediate upstream agent (the delegator), not the presenter; nesting records the full chain. Updated verification steps, sub-agent issuance, PS upstream token construction, and delegation chain examples accordingly. Replaced the "sub-agent calls a chained resource" example with "sub-agent inside a chain."

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-04
  - Auth tokens: replaced `act.sub` with `act.agent` within each `act` node; see [issue #47](https://github.com/dickhardt/AAuth/issues/47).

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-03
  - Metadata: added a common-fields table at the top of the Metadata Documents section covering all four well-known files; documented intentional RFC 9728 divergences (`issuer` not `resource`; unprefixed field names).
  - Metadata: added `documentation_uri` to `aauth-agent.json`, `aauth-person.json`, and `aauth-access.json`.
  - Interaction code: updated Crockford base32 citation to `[@?I-D.crockford-davis-base32-for-humans]`.

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-02
  - Added sub-agents: agent token `parent_agent` claim, single-level depth, parent-mediated authorization with a `subagent_token` parameter, and the `+` sub-agent local-part delimiter; registered `parent_agent` in the JWT Claims registry.
  - Renamed the terminal `interaction_required` error to `user_unreachable`; added `interaction_unavailable` (424) and PS-first interaction relay; clarified completion polling for resource-hosted interactions; added the `max_wait` interaction parameter.
  - Added `capabilities` and OIDC `prompt` request parameters to the PS token endpoint.
  - Added `requirement=agent-token` (`401`); ordered the resource-access challenge sections weakest-to-strongest.
  - Added an `access_mode` resource-metadata field, a "Drop-In Replacement for API Keys and OAuth" section, and a "Consuming a Resource End to End" walkthrough; relaxed `jwks_uri` to be required only when the resource issues resource tokens or makes signed calls.
  - Added an OPTIONAL Markdown `description` field to each well-known metadata document.
  - Metadata: require the returned `issuer` to match the URL it was fetched from.
  - Call chaining: clarified that the intermediary signs with its own key and `upstream_token` is a body parameter.
  - Added rationale for the mandated covered components in the HTTP Message Signatures profile.
  - Added a Security Consideration on non-repudiation after key rotation; clarified that the agent token is AAuth's minimum credential (identity Signature-Key schemes only; pseudonym `hwk`/`jkt-jwt` not an AAuth mode).
  - Bootstrapping: pointer to the AAuth Bootstrap document; resources SHOULD publish `access_mode` and an R3 vocabulary.
  - Diagrams: use snake_case `agent_token` and `auth_token`.
  - Named the `{approver, s256}` pair the "mission reference" and used it consistently for the `mission` claim in resource and auth tokens, distinct from the full mission blob.
  - Stated that AAuth never conveys its own requirements via `WWW-Authenticate`, leaving a resource's existing challenges available alongside `AAuth-Requirement`.
  - Specified the interaction `code` format: Crockford base32 alphabet, ≥40 bits of entropy, presentational hyphens stripped before case-insensitive comparison, single use, mandatory rate-limiting, and expiry bound to the pending interaction; documented the entropy/rate-limit rules as the brute-force defense in Interaction Code Misdirection and made the four `code` examples consistently hyphenated.
  - Editorial consistency pass: trimmed redundant mode walkthroughs, removed the empty "Clarification Flow" subsection, and added distinct anchors to the appendix flow diagrams.

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-01
  - Renamed PS-managed access to PS-asserted access throughout, reflecting the trust posture: the resource accepts identity claims and consent from the agent's PS while applying its own access policy.
  - Renamed Agent Server to Agent Provider (AP) throughout, including in agent identifier definition, well-known metadata, and IANA registrations.
  - Added Roles section describing collocation patterns (PS+AS, Resource+Agent, AP+Resource, Agent+AP, org-wide bundles).
  - Added Policy Evaluation Points section describing how AP, PS, AS, and Resource each evaluate the agent from their own vantage point.
  - Added PS-AS Collapse subsection distinguishing it from three-party access.
  - Added Trust Posture in PS-Asserted Access security section.
  - Added optional `platform` request parameter (with new IANA AAuth Platform Value Registry: `web`, `mobile`, `desktop`, `workload`, `self-hosted`) and `device` request parameter at the PS token endpoint, both agent-attested and used for display at the consent screen and connected-agents dashboard.
  - Replaced ad hoc `org` references with the `tenant` claim from OpenID Connect Enterprise Extensions; added `tenant` as an optional auth token claim.
  - Consistency pass: identity-based access now requires an agent token (collapsed agent adoption path from 4 to 3 steps); audit's mission requirement no longer hidden by the "missions, permissions, audit" shorthand; `capabilities` array on mission approval is "MAY include"; `ps` claim in agent token is "MUST include" for three-party and above; auth token usage clarified (agent presents auth token, not agent token, on subsequent requests to a resource).
  - Demoted the AAuth Bootstrap reference from normative to informative.

- draft-hardt-oauth-aauth-protocol-00
  - Initial draft. Replaces [draft-hardt-aauth-protocol-02](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hardt-aauth-protocol/02/); no technical changes.

# Detailed Flows {#detailed-flows}

This appendix provides flow diagrams for the chaining patterns defined in the main specification, where the choreography is hard to follow from prose alone.

## Four-Party: Call Chaining {#flow-call-chaining}

See (#call-chaining) for normative requirements. Resource 1 acts as an agent, sending the downstream resource token plus its own agent token and the upstream auth token to the PS.

## Interaction Chaining {#flow-interaction-chaining}

See (#interaction-chaining) for normative requirements. When the PS requires user interaction for the downstream access, Resource 1 chains the interaction back to the original agent.

# Design Rationale

## Identity and Foundation

### Why HTTPS-Based Agent Identity

HTTPS URLs as agent identifiers enable dynamic ecosystems without pre-registration.

### Why Per-Instance Agent Identity

OAuth's `client_id` identifies an application — every instance of the same app shares a single identifier and typically a single set of credentials. AAuth's `aauth:local@domain` agent identifier identifies a specific instance with its own signing key. This enables per-instance authorization (grant access to this specific agent process, not all instances of the app), per-instance revocation (revoke one compromised instance without affecting others), and per-instance audit (trace every action to the specific instance that performed it). The agent provider controls which instances receive agent tokens, providing centralized governance over a distributed agent fleet.

### Why Agents Are Under an Agent Provider

Placing agents under an agent provider rather than allowing each agent to self-certify its own identity serves two purposes. First, **scale**: a single agent provider can issue, rotate, and revoke agent tokens across a fleet of thousands of instances. Resources and PSes verify agent tokens by fetching the AP's JWKS — one trust anchor for all agents from that provider — rather than performing individual key management with each instance. Second, **policy enforcement**: the AP is a natural PEP for agents. It controls which agent instances receive tokens, what identity claims they carry, and when tokens are denied or revoked. An agent that is also its own AP would bypass this layer entirely, eliminating the governance point without gaining anything: the protocol complexity increases while the security properties weaken. AAuth therefore requires every agent to hold a token issued by a distinct AP, not self-signed.

### Why Every Agent Has a Person

Every agent acts on behalf of a person — the entity accountable for the agent's actions. AAuth enables a person server to maintain this link, making it visible and enforceable across the protocol. When present, the PS ensures there is always an accountable party for authorization decisions, audit, and liability.

### Why the `ps` Claim in Agent Tokens

Resources need to discover the agent's PS to issue resource tokens in three-party mode. The `ps` claim in the agent token provides this discovery without requiring the `AAuth-Mission` header, which is only present when the agent is operating within a mission. This separates PS discovery from mission governance — an agent can use three-party mode without missions.

## Protocol Mechanics

### Why `.json` in Well-Known URIs

AAuth well-known metadata URIs use the `.json` extension (e.g., `/.well-known/aauth-agent.json`) rather than the extensionless convention used by OAuth and OpenID Connect. The `.json` extension makes the content type immediately obvious — no content negotiation is needed. More importantly, it enables static file hosting: a `.json` file served from GitHub Pages, S3, or a CDN works without server-side configuration. This aligns with AAuth's self-hosted agent model (see [@?I-D.hardt-aauth-bootstrap]), where an agent's metadata can be published as static files with no active server.

### Why Standard HTTP Async Pattern

AAuth uses standard HTTP async semantics (`202 Accepted`, `Location`, `Prefer: wait`, `Retry-After`). This applies uniformly to all endpoints, aligns with RFC 7240, replaces OAuth device flow, supports headless agents, and enables clarification chat.

### Why JSON Instead of Form-Encoded

JSON is the standard format for modern APIs. AAuth uses JSON for both request and response bodies.

### Why No Authorization Code

AAuth eliminates authorization codes entirely. OAuth authorization codes require PKCE ([@RFC7636]) to prevent interception attacks, adding complexity for both clients and servers. AAuth avoids the problem: the user redirect carries only the callback URL, which has no security value to an attacker. The auth token is delivered exclusively via polling, authenticated by the agent's HTTP Message Signature.

### Why Callback URL Has No Security Role

Tokens never pass through the user's browser. The callback URL is purely a UX optimization.

### Why No Refresh Token

AAuth has no refresh tokens. When an auth token expires, the agent obtains a fresh resource token and submits it through the standard authorization flow. This gives the resource a voice in every re-authorization — the resource can adjust scope, require step-up authorization, or deny access based on current policy. A separate refresh token would bypass the resource entirely, and is unnecessary given that the standard flow is a single additional request.

### Why Reuse OpenID Connect Vocabulary

AAuth reuses OpenID Connect scope values, identity claims, and enterprise parameters. This lowers the adoption barrier.

## Architecture

### Why a Separate Person Server

The PS is distinct from the AS because they serve different parties with different concerns. The PS represents the agent and its user — it handles consent, identity, mission governance, and audit. The AS represents the resource — it evaluates policy and issues tokens. Combining these into a single entity would conflate the interests of the requesting party with the interests of the resource owner, which is the same conflation that makes OAuth insufficient for cross-domain agent ecosystems.

### Why Four Resource Access Modes

The protocol supports identity-based, resource-managed (two-party), PS-asserted (three-party), and federated (four-party) resource access modes, with agent governance as an orthogonal layer. A resource that only verifies agent signatures can start using AAuth today without deploying a PS or AS. As the ecosystem matures, the same resource can accept identity claims from any agent's PS (three-party) and eventually deploy its own AS (four-party). Each mode is self-contained and useful — not a stepping stone to the "real" protocol. Agent governance (missions plus permission, audit, and interaction relay) works independently of resource access modes.

### Why Resource Tokens

In GNAP and OAuth, the resource server is a passive consumer of tokens — it verifies them but never produces signed artifacts. AAuth inverts this: the resource cryptographically asserts what is being requested by issuing a resource token that binds the resource's own identity, the agent's key thumbprint, the requested scope, and the mission context into a single signed JWT. This prevents confused deputy attacks — an attacker cannot substitute a different resource in the authorization flow because the resource token is signed by the resource. It also gives the resource a voice in every authorization and re-authorization, and provides a complete audit artifact linking the request to a specific resource, agent, scope, and mission.

### Why Opaque AAuth-Access Tokens

In two-party mode, the resource returns an opaque wrapped token via the `AAuth-Access` header rather than a JWT auth token. This allows the resource to wrap its existing authorization infrastructure (OAuth access tokens, session tokens, etc.) without exposing internal structure. The token is bound to the AAuth signature — the agent includes it in the `Authorization` header as a covered component — so it cannot be stolen and replayed as a standalone bearer token.

### Why Missions Are Not a Policy Language

Missions are intentionally not a machine-evaluable policy language. AAuth separates two kinds of authorization decisions:

- **Deterministic policy** is handled by scopes, resource tokens, and AS policy evaluation. These are mechanically evaluable — "does this agent have `data.read` scope for this resource?" A policy engine (Cedar, OPA/Rego, or any other) can answer this question consistently and automatically.

- **Contextual governance** is handled by missions, justifications, and clarification at the PS. These are the contextual decisions that policy engines cannot answer — "is booking a $10,000 flight reasonable for planning a weekend trip?" or "should this agent access the HR database given what it's trying to accomplish?" The mission description, the agent's justification for each resource access, and the clarification dialog between user and agent provide the context for these decisions.

Prior attempts to make authorization semantics machine-evaluable across domains have not scaled. OAuth Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) require clients and servers to agree on domain-specific `type` values and JSON structures — workable within a single API but combinatorially explosive across arbitrary services. UMA attempted cross-domain resource sharing with machine-readable permission tickets, but adoption stalled because resource owners, requesting parties, and authorization servers could not converge on shared semantics for what permissions meant across organizational boundaries. The fundamental problem is that the meaning of "appropriate access" is contextual, evolving, and domain-specific — it cannot be captured in a predefined vocabulary that all parties share.

Missions solve this differently. Rather than requiring all parties to agree on machine-evaluable semantics, AAuth concentrates governance evaluation at the PS — the only party with full context. The PS has the mission description, the user's identity and organizational context, the agent's justification for each request, the history of what the agent has done so far, and a channel to the user for clarification. No other party in the protocol has this context, and no predefined policy language can substitute for it.

This context can be presented to humans or to agents acting as decision-makers. The PS does not need to evaluate missions deterministically — it presents the mission context, the justification, and the resource request to whatever decision-maker is appropriate: a human reviewing a consent screen, an AI agent evaluating policy on behalf of an organization, or an automated system applying heuristics. As AI decision-making matures, governance can shift from human review to agent evaluation — without changing the protocol. AAuth standardizes how context is conveyed to the decision-maker; it does not prescribe how the decision is made.

The mission's `description` is Markdown because it represents human intent, not machine policy. The `approved_tools` array provides structured machine-evaluable elements where appropriate. Resources and access servers do not need the mission content — they enforce their own deterministic policies independently. The mission is a further restriction applied by the PS, and only the PS has sufficient context to evaluate it. Distributing mission semantics to other parties would be both a privacy leak and a false promise of enforcement, since those parties lack the context to evaluate the mission meaningfully.

### Why Missions Have Only Two States

Missions are either **active** or **terminated**. There is no suspended state. A suspended state would require the agent to learn that the mission has resumed, but AAuth has no push channel from the PS to the agent — the agent can only poll. For short pauses (minutes), the deferred response mechanism already provides natural waiting via `202` polling. For long pauses (hours or more), the agent would need to poll indefinitely with no indication of when to stop, making suspension operationally equivalent to termination. Terminating the mission and creating a new one is cleaner — the PS retains the old mission's log for audit, and the new mission can be scoped appropriately for the changed circumstances that prompted the pause. This keeps mission lifecycle simple: a mission is alive until it is done.

### Why Downstream Scope Is Not Constrained by Upstream Scope

In multi-hop scenarios, downstream authorization is intentionally not required to be a subset of upstream scopes. A flight booking API that calls a payment processor needs the payment processor to charge a card — an operation orthogonal to the upstream scope. Formal subset rules would prevent legitimate delegation chains. Instead, the PS evaluates each hop against the mission context, providing governance-based constraints that are more flexible than algebraic attenuation rules while maintaining a complete audit trail.

## Comparisons with Alternatives

### Why Not mTLS?

Mutual TLS (mTLS) authenticates the TLS connection, not individual HTTP requests. Different paths on the same resource may have different requirements — some paths may require no signature, others a signed request, others verified identity, and others an auth token. Per-request signatures allow resources to vary requirements by path. Additionally, mTLS requires PKI infrastructure (CA, certificate provisioning, revocation), cannot express progressive requirements, and is stripped by TLS-terminating proxies and CDNs. mTLS remains the right choice for infrastructure-level mutual authentication (e.g., service mesh). AAuth addresses application-level identity where progressive requirements and intermediary compatibility are needed.

### Why Not DPoP?

DPoP ([@RFC9449]) binds an existing OAuth access token to a key, preventing token theft. AAuth differs in that agents can establish identity from zero — no pre-existing token, no pre-registration. The agent signs with its own agent token (#agent-tokens), which it obtains from its agent provider without any resource-side registration; no resource- or AS-issued token is needed to make the first identified call. DPoP has a single mode (prove you hold the key bound to this token), while AAuth supports progressive requirements from verified agent identity through authorized access with interactive consent. DPoP is the right choice for adding proof-of-possession to existing OAuth deployments.

### Why Not Extend GNAP

GNAP ([@RFC9635]) shares several motivations with AAuth — proof-of-possession by default, client identity without pre-registration, and async authorization. A natural question is whether AAuth's capabilities could be achieved as GNAP extensions rather than a new protocol. There are several reasons they cannot.

**Resource tokens require an architectural change, not an extension.** In GNAP, as in OAuth, the resource server is a passive consumer of tokens — it verifies them but never produces signed artifacts that the access server consumes. AAuth's resource tokens invert this: the resource cryptographically asserts what is being requested, binding its own identity, the agent's key thumbprint, and the requested scope into a signed JWT. Adding this to GNAP would require changing its core architectural assumption about the role of the resource server.

**Interaction chaining requires a different continuation model.** GNAP's continuation mechanism operates between a single client and a single access server. When a resource needs to access a downstream resource that requires user consent, GNAP has no mechanism for that consent requirement to propagate back through the call chain to the original user. Supporting this would require rethinking GNAP's continuation model to support multi-party propagation through intermediaries.

**The federation model is fundamentally different.** In GNAP, the client must discover and interact with each access server directly. AAuth's model — where the agent only ever talks to its PS, and the PS federates with resource ASes — is a different trust topology, not a configuration option. Retrofitting this into GNAP would produce a profile so constrained that it would be a distinct protocol in practice.

**GNAP's generality is a liability for this use case.** GNAP is designed to be maximally flexible — interaction modes, key proofing methods, token formats, and access structures are all pluggable. This means implementers must make dozens of profiling decisions before arriving at an interoperable system. AAuth makes these decisions prescriptively: one token format (JWT), one key proofing method (HTTP Message Signatures), one interaction pattern (interaction codes with polling), and one identity model (`local@domain` with HTTPS metadata). For the agent-to-resource ecosystem, this prescriptiveness is a feature — it enables interoperability without bilateral agreements.

In summary, AAuth's core innovations — resource-signed challenges, interaction chaining through multi-hop calls, PS-to-AS federation, mission-scoped authorization, and clarification chat during consent — are architectural choices that would require changing GNAP's foundations rather than extending them. The result would be a heavily constrained GNAP profile that shares little with other GNAP deployments.

### Why Not Extend WWW-Authenticate?

`WWW-Authenticate` ([@!RFC9110], Section 11.6.1) tells the client which authentication scheme to use. Its challenge model is "present credentials" — it cannot express progressive requirements, authorization, or deferred approval, and it cannot appear in a `202 Accepted` response.

`AAuth-Requirement` and `Accept-Signature` coexist with `WWW-Authenticate`. A `401` response MAY include multiple headers, and the client uses whichever it understands:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="api"
Accept-Signature: sig=("@method" "@authority" "@path");sigkey=uri
```

A `402` response MAY include `WWW-Authenticate` for payment (e.g., the Payment scheme defined by the Micropayment Protocol ([@!I-D.ryan-httpauth-payment])) alongside `Accept-Signature` for authentication or `AAuth-Requirement` for authorization:

```http
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
WWW-Authenticate: Payment id="x7Tg2pLq", method="example",
    request="eyJhbW91bnQiOiIxMDAw..."
Accept-Signature: sig=("@method" "@authority" "@path");sigkey=jkt
```

### Why Not Extend OAuth?

OAuth 2.0 ([@!RFC6749]) was designed for delegated access — a user authorizes a pre-registered client to act on their behalf at a specific server. Extending OAuth for agent-to-resource authorization would require changing its foundational assumptions:

- **Client identity**: OAuth clients have no independent identity. A `client_id` is issued by each authorization server — it is meaningless outside that relationship. AAuth agents have self-sovereign identity (`aauth:local@domain`) verifiable by any party.
- **Pre-registration**: OAuth requires clients to register with each authorization server before use. AAuth agents call resources they have never contacted before — the first API call is the registration.
- **Bearer tokens**: OAuth access tokens are bearer credentials — anyone who holds the token can use it. AAuth binds every token to a signing key via HTTP Message Signatures — a stolen token is useless without the private key.
- **No resource identity**: OAuth does not cryptographically identify the resource. AAuth resources sign resource tokens, binding their identity to the authorization flow.
- **No governance layer**: OAuth has no concept of missions, permission endpoints, audit logging, or interaction relay. These would need to be built on top as extensions, losing the coherence of a protocol designed around them.
- **No federation model**: OAuth's authorization server is always the resource owner's server. AAuth separates the person server (user's choice) from the access server (resource's choice) and defines how they federate.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) illustrates these limitations. MCP adopted OAuth 2.1 for agent-to-server authorization and immediately needed Dynamic Client Registration ([@RFC7591]) because agents cannot pre-register with every server. But Dynamic Client Registration gives the agent a different `client_id` at each server — the agent still has no portable identity. Tokens are bearer credentials, so a stolen token grants full access. There is no resource identity — the server does not cryptographically prove who it is. There is no governance layer — no missions, no permission management, no audit trail. And the entire authorization model is per-server: each MCP server has its own authorization server, and the agent must discover and register with each one independently. MCP's experience demonstrates that OAuth can be made to work for the first API call, but it cannot provide the identity, governance, and federation that agents need as they operate across trust domains.

Rather than layer these changes onto OAuth — which would break backward compatibility and produce something unrecognizable — AAuth is a new protocol designed for the agent model from the ground up. AAuth complements OAuth: resources can wrap existing OAuth infrastructure behind the AAuth-Access token, and PSes can delegate user authentication to OpenID Connect providers.
